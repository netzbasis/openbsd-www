<ul>
<li id="bootpd">
<font color="#009000"><strong>SECURITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A remotely exploitable problem exists in bootpd(8).  bootpd is disabled
by default, but some people may actually be using it.

<p>
<li id="atapi">
<font color="#009000"><strong>HARDWARE SUPPORT</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Some ATAPI cdroms which do not support the full mandatory command set,
(e.g. ATAPI_READ_CD_CAPACITY) do not work with the acd(4) driver.
A patch is
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/acd.patch">

<p>
<li id="chpass">
<font color="#009000"><strong>SECURITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Chpass(1) has a file descriptor leak which allows an
attacker to modify /etc/master.passwd.

<p>
<li id="resid">
<font color="#009000"><strong>RELIABILITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Calling readv(2) with iov_len &lt; 0 or &gt; INT_MAX would result in a
kernel panic.  This is the third revision of this patch.

<p>
<li id="inetd">
<font color="#009000"><strong>SECURITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Inetd had a file descriptor leak.  A patch is
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/inetd.patch">
available here.</a>
<p>
<li id="unionfs">
<font color="#009000"><strong>BUG FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
As shipped, unionfs had some serious problems.
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/unionfs.patch">
A patch is available to solve this</a>.
<p>
<li id="fdalloc">
<font color="#009000"><strong>SECURITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Some non-allocated file descriptors have implied uses according to
system libraries, and hence setuid and setgid processes should not
be executed with these descriptors unallocated.  A patch which forces
setuid and setgid processes to have some descriptors in fd slots
0, 1, and 2 is
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/fdalloc.patch">
available here.</a>
<p>
<li id="resolver">
<font color="#009000"><strong>SECURITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A benign looking buffer overflow in the resolver routines was re-introduced
accidentally.  The previously fixed behaviour is more correct.  A patch
to fix this is
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/resolver.patch">
available here.</a>
<p>
<li id="xlib">
<font color="#009000"><strong>SECURITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Vulnerabilities have been found in the X11, Xt, Xaw and Xmu
libraries. These affect xterm and all other setuid-root programs that
use these libraries. The problems are associated with buffer overflows
in code that processes user-supplied data. The Xt library problems
include those fixed in TOG's recent public patch 3 for X11R6.3. All
releases of XFree86 up to and including 3.3.2 patch 1 and the version
distributed with OpenBSD are vulnerable to some or all of these
problems.
These problems are fixed in XFree86 patch 2.
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/XFree86-3.3.2.2.patch">
The 2nd source patch</a> for these problems, specifically adapted to the
OpenBSD 2.3 X11 tree, is available now.
<p>
<li id="kill">
<font color="#009000"><strong>SECURITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
The kill(2) system call previously would permit a large set of signals to
be delivered to setuid or setgid processes.  If such processes were using
those signals in dubious ways, this could have resulted in security
problems of various kinds.
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/kill.patch">
The fourth revision of a source code patch which solves the problem is
available.</a>
<p>
<li id="immutable">
<font color="#009000"><strong>SECURITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A possible new security problem exists if you rely on securelevels and
immutable or append-only files or character devices.  The fix does not
permit mmap'ing of immutable or append-only files which are otherwise
writable, as the VM system will bypass the meaning of the file flags
when writes happen to the file.
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/immutable.patch">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
<p>
<li id="ipsec">
<font color="#009000"><strong>SECURITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
If IPSEC communication is attempted by starting photurisd(8) (which is
disabled by default), a system crash may be evoked from remote if
an attacker uses some classes of invalid packets.
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/ipsec.patch">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
<p>
<li id="xterm-xaw">
<font color="#009000"><strong>SECURITY FIX</strong></font>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
As stated in CERT advisory VB-98.04, there are buffer
overrun problems in <strong>xterm</strong> related to the input-Method,
preeditType, and *Keymap resources. Additional buffer overruns exist in
the <strong>Xaw</strong> library related to the inputMethod and
preeditType resources.   The xterm(1) problem represents a security
vulnerability for any platform where xterm is installed setuid-root
(as is the case for all OpenBSD platforms).  The Xaw problem represents
a security vulnerability for any setuid-root program that uses the Xaw
library (including xterm).  Patch1 from XFree86 3.3.2 corrects
these problems.
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/xterm-xaw.patch">
We provide a version of this patch file specifically for the OpenBSD 2.3 tree</a>.
We also provide tar files which replace the xterm(1) binary and the libXaw
libraries on your system. These are expected to be extracted in
<strong>/usr/X11R6</strong> using the command
<strong>"tar xvfpz Xawfix.tgz"</strong>.
The files are...

<p>
<li id="pctr">
<font color="#009000"><strong>RELIABILITY FIX</strong></font><br>
The pctr(4) driver has bugs that permit any user to crash the machine,
if the CPU is not an Intel CPU.  This problem has been properly fixed
since, but fixes are hard to apply to the 2.2 or 2.3 releases.  To avoid
the problem, recompile your kernel without the pctr(4) device driver.
<p>
<li><font color="#009000"><strong>CORRUPTED FILE</strong></font><br>
The CD version of the precompiled ghostscript package is corrupted and
not installable.  The correct file can be retrieved by FTP from:
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.3/packages/i386/ghostscript-5.10.tgz">
http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.3/packages/i386/ghostscript-5.10.tgz</a>.
Its checksums (obtained with <i>cksum(1)</i>, <i>md5(1)</i> and
<i>sha1(1)</i> respectively) are:
<ul>
<li>725752890 3639338 ghostscript-5.10.tgz
<li>MD5 (ghostscript-5.10.tgz) = 3144ca814ad1965d671be2b7be3d3050
<li>SHA1 (ghostscript-5.10.tgz) = bd9374fa547ac0078d5207463d3b0a19d80d213c
</ul>
<p>
<li id="pcvt">
<font color="#009000"><strong>RELIABILITY FIX</strong></font><br>
The pcvt(4) console driver has a bug that can cause some keyboard
controllers to lock up when a key is pressed that toggles the status
of a keyboard LED (scroll lock, caps lock, etc).  The problem is
generally intermittent and the keyboard can be "unlocked" by unplugging
and plugging it back in.

<li><font color="#009000"><strong>RELIABILITY FIX</strong></font><br>
The 2.3 release does not run reliably on the sun4m LX/LC machines
(ie. Sparc Classic).
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/sparc/iommureg.patch">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
Two kernels which replace the ones in the release are also provided:
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/sparc/bsd">bsd</a> and
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/sparc/bsd.scsi3">bsd.scsi3</a>.
Other replacements for the 2.3 install tools are
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/sparc">also available</a>.
<p>
<li><font color="#009000"><strong>MINOR INCOMPATIBILITY</strong></font><br>
The AmigaOS patch
<a href="http://us.aminet.net/pub/aminet/util/sys/PoolMem.lha">PoolMem</a>
improves AmigaOS memory handling tremendously, but confuses loadbsd, which
grabs less memory from the system than is available. To work around the
problem, be sure to execute
<pre>
    PoolMem remove
</pre>
right before running loadbsd. The next release of loadbsd will probably be
PoolMem-aware.
<p>
<li><font color="#009000"><strong>RELEASE WARNING</strong></font><br>
The XFree86 binary set shipped on the CD and FTP site are not the
exact final set that we shipped for the other releases.  A few minor
changes, mostly in <strong>xdm(1)</strong> configuration, were made
after those binaries were made.  Patches for this might come out later.
<p>
<li><font color="#009000"><strong>X11 RELEASE ERROR</strong></font><br>
The XFree86 binary set was linked with an older version of the C
library.  To work around the problem, do the following as root.

<pre>
    cd /usr/lib/
    ln -s libc.so.18.0 libc.so.17
</pre>
<p>
<li><font color="#009000"><strong>X11 RELEASE ERROR</strong></font><br>
The X11R5 server used in this port does not understand the default
authorization types used by the X11R6 clients, which results in no
clients being able to connect to the  server.  To fix this
problem add the line below to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config.

<li><font color="#009000"><strong>INSTALLATION PROCESS FLAW</strong></font><br>
The pmax install does not correctly install the boot block.
To work around the problem, after the install program has finished, do
the following (assuming scsi id 0):

    disklabel rz0 > /tmp/label
    disklabel -R -B rz0 /tmp/label
