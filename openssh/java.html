The following "free" clients are recommended for interoperating with
OpenSSH from Java clients:<p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.isnetworks.com/ssh/">MindTerm 1</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation. GPL Licence.
<p>

"MindTerm is an entirely FREE(*) SSH protocol 1 client program
written in 100% pure Java (non-certified). It is distributed with
source code since we believe that security related software can't
otherwise be seriously trusted. MindTerm can be run as a stand-alone
program or as an applet in a webpage. It can be run with or without a
GUI (stand-alone). It has two notable features setting it apart from
some other clients, built in scp file transfer and a special
ftp-tunnel which works with "ordinary" ftpd's "behind" the sshd."<p>
NOTE: Mindterm 2 is not free.
<p>

<li><a href="http://javatelnet.org/space/start">SSH Plugin</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation, by Matthias L. Jugel and Marcus Mei&szlig;ner.
GPL Licence.<p>

"This implementation of SSH provides IDEA and RSA/PKCS#1 encryption and
was originally written in 1998 by C&eacute;dric Gourio. He used a part of the
old Java Telnet Applet to write his Java SSH client and so the code
was similar to our old applet."
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.cleondra.ch/ssh2">Ganymed SSH-2 for Java</a>.
BSD style license.<p>

"Ganymed SSH-2 for Java is a freely available open-source library which
implements the SSH-2 protocol in pure Java. It supports SSH sessions
(remote command execution and shell access), local and remote port
forwarding, local stream forwarding, X11 forwarding, SCP and SFTP.
There are no dependencies on any JCE provider, as all crypto functionality
is included."
<p>

</ul>
