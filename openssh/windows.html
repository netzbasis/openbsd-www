<hr>

The following "free" SSH implementations are recommended for
interoperating with OpenSSH from Windows machines:<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
is an SSH1+SSH2 implementation.  PSCP, an
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scp">scp</a>-style
program for Windows, is also available.
<p>
PuTTY is available under the MIT licence (BSD-like).
<p>

"PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32 platforms,
written and maintained primarily by Simon Tatham, who lives in Great Britain."
<p>

<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050702021104/http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html">TTSSH (SSH1)</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation, by Robert O'Callahan.
<p>

"TTSSH is a free SSH client for Windows. It is implemented as an
extension DLL for Teraterm Pro. Teraterm Pro is a superb free terminal
emulator/telnet client for Windows, and its source is available. TTSSH
adds SSH capabilities to Teraterm Pro without sacrificing any of
Teraterm's existing functionality. TTSSH is also free to download and
use and its source is available too, with an open source
license. Furthermore, TTSSH has been developed entirely in Australia [...]."
<p>

A variant <a href="http://ttssh2.sourceforge.jp/">UTF-8 TeraTerm Pro
with TTSSH2</a> version is also available.
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin (POSIX software on top of Windows)</a>
<p>
OpenSSH (SSH1 and SSH2 protocol) with Cygwin can run on Windows using the
<a href="portable.html">portable version of OpenSSH</a>, which can be either
built from source or installed as a Cygwin native package.
<p>

<li><a href="http://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a>
<p>
WinSCP is a GUI sftp(1) and scp(1) client program for Windows.  Its SSH
protocol core is based on PuTTY.
<p>

<li><a href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/">FileZilla</a>
<p>
FileZilla is a powerful FTP-client for Windows 9x, ME, NT4, 2000 and XP.
It has been designed for ease of use and with support for as many
features as possible, while still being fast and reliable. It supports
SFTP.
