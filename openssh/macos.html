The following clients are recommended for interoperating with OpenSSH
from Mac OS machines. Note that Mac OS X includes OpenSSH by default.
<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jonasw/freeware/niftyssh/">NiftyTelnet 1.1 SSH</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation which comes with a
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org?query=scp">scp</a>-style
program.  Written by Jonas Wallden.<p>

"NiftyTelnet 1.1 SSH r3 is an enhanced version of Chris Newman's
NiftyTelnet 1.1 application which adds support for encrypted terminal
sessions using the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. Please read the
included Readme file before distributing this version."
<p>

<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/macssh/">MacSSH</a> is an SSH2-only
implementation.
<p>

"MacSSH is a modified version of BetterTelnet with SSH2 support. [...]
The only SSH2 client for Mac OS that I could find is a commercial
product thats costs more than $100, and it crashes my Mac when closing a
session... Since it's best to do things by oneself, here's MacSSH."
<p>

<li><a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">Fugu</a> is an
implementation of SFTP and SCP for Mac OS X.
<p>

"Fugu SSH is a Mac OS X graphical frontend to OpenSSH's Secure File
Transfer application (SFTP). Fugu allows you to take advantage of SFTP's
security without having to sacrifice the ease of use found in a GUI.
Fugu also includes support for SCP files transfers, and the ability to
create secure tunnels through SSH."
<p>

<li><a href="http://cyberduck.ch/">Cyberduck</a> is an SFTP and FTP
browser for Mac OS X.
<p>

"Cyberduck is an open source SFTP (SSH Secure File Transfer) and FTP
browser licenced under the GPL. It has been built from the ground up
with usability in mind, having the same consistent graphical user
interface for both SFTP and FTP browsing. Multiple connections are
supported. [...] Core system technologies such as the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/security/">Keychain</a>
and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/rendezvous/">Rendezvous</a>
are supported."

</ul>
