If you choose not to use OpenSSH on Unix, the following "free" SSH
implementations are available for interoperating with OpenSSH:<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/krypto/ossh/">OSSH</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation. BSD Licence.
<p>

Bj&ouml;rn Gr&ouml;nvall was the original person to remind our
community that very old versions of the real ssh had a free licence.
This is his own implementation, based on the old Tatu code.
OpenSSH was based on an early version of OSSH, but OpenSSH added
SSH2 and extended the SSH1 protocol support.
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.net.lut.ac.uk/psst/">LSH/psst</a>
is an SSH2-only implementation, by Niels M&ouml;ller in Sweden,
GPL Licence.
<p>

"ssh uses cryptographic techniques to enhance the security of everyday
distributed computing tasks such as file transfers, remote logins and
remote command execution. It's intended as a (more) secure alternative
to the likes of telnet, ftp, rsh, rlogin and rexec - and one which
requires much less effort to set up than Kerberos or IPSEC currently
do."
<p>

<li><a href="http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html">Dropbear</a>
is a small SSH2 server-only implementation written by Matt Johnston.
It is available under a MIT-style license.
<p>

</ul>
