<p>
Our goal is simple: Since telnet and rlogin are insecure, all
operating systems should ship with support for the SSH protocol
included.
<p>

The SSH protocol is available in two incompatible varieties:
SSH 1 and SSH 2.
<p>

The older SSH 1 protocol comes in two major sub-variants:
protocol 1.3 and protocol 1.5.  Both are supported by OpenSSH, but disabled
at compile time due to their insecurity.
Both of these use the asymmetric cryptography algorithm
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rsa">RSA</a>
(for which the USA patent has expired, allowing full use by everyone)
for key negotiation, and then use a
short list of symmetric algorithms for data hiding: 
3DES and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/blowfish">Blowfish</a>.
(There used to be a few other algorithms like RC4, but their 
implementations had even worse security problems).
Some SSH 1 protocol implementations also support the IDEA symmetric
algorithm, but since this algorithm is patented in some nations, OpenSSH
ships without support for IDEA. OpenSSH code including full SSH 1.3 and SSH
1.5 protocol support shipped on December 1, 1999.
<p>

The SSH 1 protocol uses a simple CRC for data integrity, which turns out
to be flawed. An insertion attack is known to be possible, however, due
to a number of bandaids which have been applied to SSH implementations over
the years, attacks against it are very difficult to perform. When the 3DES
cipher is used, the insertion attack is significantly less possible.
<p>

The second major variety of SSH is the SSH 2 protocol.  SSH 2 was
invented to avoid the patent issues regarding RSA (patent issues which
no longer apply, since the patent has expired), to fix the CRC data
integrity problem that SSH1 has, and for a number of other technical
reasons.  By using the asymmetric
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dsa">DSA</a>
and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dh">DH</a>
algorithms,
protocol 2 avoids all patents.  The CRC problem is also solved by
using a real
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/HMAC">HMAC</a>
algorithm. The SSH 2 protocol supports many other choices for symmetric
ciphers, as well as many other new features.
<p>

OpenSSH relies on the <a href="https://www.libressl.org">LibreSSL</a>
library for some of its cryptographic routines, AES-GCM being one example.
<p>

Continuing that trend, the OpenBSD project members who worked on
OpenSSH made a push at supporting the SSH 2 protocol as well.  This
work was primarily done by Markus Friedl.  Around May 4, 2000, the
SSH 2 protocol support was implemented sufficiently to be usable.
