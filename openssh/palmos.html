<hr>

The following "free" clients are recommended for interoperating with
OpenSSH from Palm OS clients:<p>


<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.ai/~iang/TGssh/">Top Gun ssh</a> using
<a href="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/pilot/">pilotSSLeay</a>
<p>
"Top Gun ssh is an ssh (version 1) client for palmtops running
Palm OS and having a TCP/IP stack.  This includes the Palm Pilot
Pro, Palm III, Palm V, and the corresponding models of Workpad and
Visor. It does not include the Palm VII; that machine apparently
has no way to do TCP/IP."</li>

<li><a href="http://www.sealiesoftware.com/pssh/">pssh</a>
<p>
"pssh is a free, open-source SSH 2 client for Palm OS. It runs on
handhelds with Palm OS 5, an ARM processor, and a 320x320 or larger
high-resolution screen."
<p>
Supports SSHv2.  Source code available. Based in part on OpenSSH.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.tussh.com/">TuSSH</a>
<p>
"TuSSH is an SSH client for Palm OS devices. It should now work with any
device with Palm OS 4 or greater. It might even work with OS 3.5 devices
but no testing or support is planned for these devices."
<p>
Supports SSHv1 and partially supports SSHv2. Free for use, but no source
available.</li>
</ul>
