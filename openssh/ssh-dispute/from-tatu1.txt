Subject: OpenSSH & the SSH trademark
Organization: SSH Communications Security, Finland

Markus & others,

As you should well know, SSH is a registered trademark and Secure
Shell is a trademark of SSH Communications Security Corp both in the
United States and in the European Union.  I have been using these
trademarks as the name of my product since 1995, and have explicitly
claimed them as trademarks from at least early 1996.  SSH
Communications Security Corp is the company that I started in 1995
around my "SSH" product.  It is now publicly listed at the Helsinki
Exchange, and employs 180 people working in various areas of
cryptographic network security.  Our SSH Secure Shell product is being
used by an estimated several million users, and is being sold under a
license from us by hundreds of distributors and OEMs in virtually
every country in the world.

I have recently started receiving a significant amount of e-mail where
people are confusing OpenSSH as either my product or my company's
product.  I have also recently seen promotional press articles
intentionally confusing the meaning of our SSH trademark, associating
it with your competing "OpenSSH" product, and intentionally distorting
e.g. the public conception about our licensing terms against the fact.

The confusion is made even worse by the fact that OpenSSH is based on
and looks like an old non-commercial version of my product (without my
approval, by the way), and the old SSH1 protocol and implementation are
known to have security problems (see e.g. the recent CERT
vulnerability notices).

Your use of the trademark is clearly in violation of the law, and is
causing me, my company, our licensees, and our products considerable
financial and other damage.

I am thus asking you to stop using the SSH or the Secure Shell
trademarks in the name of your product, or in any other confusing or
infringing manner.

You will also receive a formal notice about this from our lawyers in
the next few days.

I hope you understand that it is necessary for me to ask you to do
this.  We cannot allow you to continue to jeopardize and damage our
trademark.

Since we are both also working on the upcoming IETF working group
standard, I want to emphasize that I want to support other compatible
implementations of the standard, but I cannot allow the use of our
trademarks or other intellectual property in inappropriate and
damaging ways.

Regards,

    Tatu
