Well, I pretty much expected this.  As a result, I have tried to be
careful about this.

When we started the project, I talked to an intellectual property
lawyer about what we needed to protect ourselves, to do the right
thing with OpenSSH name, and even went as far as to discover what it
would take to challenge your trademark if we needed to, if such an
event as this ever occured.

If we do receive a letter from your lawyer, you can expect these
letters to be published widely on the Internet.  I feel that is the
traditional way to deal with these issues, as the Internet are the
userbase concerned.

Is this how you would you like to proceed?

Tatu: I greatly respect what you created.  SSH is the protocol the
internet needs to solve it's problems.  But is this really the
direction where we need to go?
