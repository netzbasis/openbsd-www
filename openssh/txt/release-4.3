OpenSSH 4.3 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We have also recently completed another Internet SSH usage scan, the 
results of which may be found at http://www.openssh.com/usage.html

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased 
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures 
and more information can be found at:
        http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html and

For international orders use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order
and for European orders, use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu

Changes since OpenSSH 4.2:
============================ 

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * CVE-2006-0225: scp (as does rcp, on which it is based) invoked a
   subshell to perform local to local, and remote to remote copy
   operations. This subshell exposed filenames to shell expansion
   twice; allowing a local attacker to create filenames containing
   shell metacharacters that, if matched by a wildcard, could lead
   to execution of attacker-specified commands with the privilege of
   the user running scp (Bugzilla #1094)

This is primarily a bug-fix release, only one new feature has been
added: 

 * Add support for tunneling arbitrary network packets over a
   connection between an OpenSSH client and server via tun(4) virtual
   network interfaces. This allows the use of OpenSSH (4.3+) to create
   a true VPN between the client and server providing real network
   connectivity at layer 2 or 3. This feature is experimental and is 
   currently supported on OpenBSD, Linux, NetBSD (IPv4 only) and 
   FreeBSD. Other operating systems with tun/tap interface capability 
   may be added in future portable OpenSSH releases. Please refer to 
   the README.tun file in the source distribution for further details
   and usage examples.

Some of the other bugs resolved and internal improvements are:

 * Reduce default key length for new DSA keys generated by ssh-keygen 
   back to 1024 bits. DSA is not specified for longer lengths and does 
   not fully benefit from simply making keys longer. As per FIPS 186-2 
   Change Notice 1, ssh-keygen will refuse to generate a new DSA key 
   smaller or larger than 1024 bits

 * Fixed X forwarding failing to start when a the X11 client is executed
   in background at the time of session exit (Bugzilla #1086)

 * Change ssh-keygen to generate a protocol 2 RSA key when invoked
   without arguments (Bugzilla #1064)

 * Fix timing variance for valid vs. invalid accounts when attempting
   Kerberos authentication (Bugzilla #975)

 * Ensure that ssh always returns code 255 on internal error (Bugzilla 
   #1137)

 * Cleanup wtmp files on SIGTERM when not using privsep (Bugzilla #1029)

 * Set SO_REUSEADDR on X11 listeners to avoid problems caused by
   lingering sockets from previous session (X11 applications can
   sometimes not connect to 127.0.0.1:60xx) (Bugzilla #1076)

 * Ensure that fds 0, 1 and 2 are always attached in all programs, by
   duping /dev/null to them if necessary.

 * Xauth list invocation had bogus "." argument (Bugzilla #1082)

 * Remove internal assumptions on key exchange hash algorithm and output
   length, preparing OpenSSH for KEX methods with alternate hashes.

 * Ignore junk sent by a server before  it sends the "SSH-" banner
   (Bugzilla #1067)

 * The manpages has been significantly improves and rearranged, in 
   addition to other specific manpage fixes:
   #1037 - Man page entries for -L and -R should mention -g.
   #1077 - Descriptions for "ssh -D" and DynamicForward should mention
           they can specify "bind_address" optionally.
   #1088 - Incorrect descriptions in ssh_config man page for 
           ControlMaster=no.
   #1121 - Several corrections for ssh_agent manpages

 * Lots of cleanups, including fixes to memory leaks on error paths
   (Bugzilla #1109, #1110, #1111 and more) and possible crashes (#1092)

 * Portable OpenSSH-specific fixes:

   - Pass random seed during re-exec for each connection: speeds up
     processing of new connections on platforms using the OpenSSH's
     builtin entropy collector (ssh-rand-helper)

   - PAM fixes and improvements:
     #1045 - Missing option for ignoring the /etc/nologin file
     #1087 - Show PAM password expiry message from LDAP on login
     #1028 - Forward final non-query conversations to client
     #1126 - Prevent user from being forced to change an expired
             password repeatedly on AIX in some PAM configurations.
     #1045 - Do not check /etc/nologin when PAM is enabled, instead 
             allow PAM to handle it.  Note that on platforms using 
             PAM, the pam_nologin module should be used in sshd's 
             session stack in order to maintain past behaviour

   - Portability-related fixes:
     #989  - Fix multiplexing regress test on Solaris
     #1097 - Cross-compile fixes.
     #1096 - ssh-keygen broken on HPUX.
     #1098 - $MAIL being set incorrectly for HPUX server login.
     #1104 - Compile error on Tru64 Unix 4.0f
     #1106 - Updated .spec file and startup for SuSE.
     #1122 - Use _GNU_SOURCE define in favor of __USE_GNU, fixing
             compilation problems on glibc 2.4

Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs or test
releases.
