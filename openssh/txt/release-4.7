OpenSSH 4.7 was released on 2007-09-05. It is available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
        http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html and

Changes since OpenSSH 4.6:
============================

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * Prevent ssh(1) from using a trusted X11 cookie if creation of an
   untrusted cookie fails; found and fixed by Jan Pechanec.

Other changes, new functionality and fixes in this release:

 * sshd(8) in new installations defaults to SSH Protocol 2 only.
   Existing installations are unchanged.

 * The SSH channel window size has been increased, and both ssh(1)
   sshd(8) now send window updates more aggressively. These improves
   performance on high-BDP (Bandwidth Delay Product) networks.

 * ssh(1) and sshd(8) now preserve MAC contexts between packets, which
   saves 2 hash calls per packet and results in 12-16% speedup for
   arcfour256/hmac-md5.

 * A new MAC algorithm has been added, UMAC-64 (RFC4418) as
   "umac-64@openssh.com". UMAC-64 has been measured to be 
   approximately 20% faster than HMAC-MD5.

 * A -K flag was added to ssh(1) to set GSSAPIAuthentication=Yes

 * Failure to establish a ssh(1) TunnelForward is now treated as a
   fatal error when the ExitOnForwardFailure option is set.

 * ssh(1) returns a sensible exit status if the control master goes
   away without passing the full exit status. (bz #1261)

 * The following bugs have been fixed in this release:

   - When using a ProxyCommand in ssh(1), set the outgoing hostname with
     gethostname(2), allowing hostbased authentication to work (bz #616)
   - Make scp(1) skip FIFOs rather than hanging (bz #856)
   - Encode non-printing characters in scp(1) filenames.
     these could cause copies to be aborted with a "protocol error"
     (bz #891)
   - Handle SIGINT in sshd(8) privilege separation child process to
     ensure that wtmp and lastlog records are correctly updated
     (bz #1196)
   - Report GSSAPI mechanism in errors, for libraries that support
     multiple mechanisms (bz #1220)
   - Improve documentation for ssh-add(1)'s -d option (bz #1224)
   - Rearrange and tidy GSSAPI code, removing server-only code being
     linked into the client. (bz #1225)
   - Delay execution of ssh(1)'s LocalCommand until after all forwadings
     have been established. (bz #1232)
   - In scp(1), do not truncate non-regular files (bz #1236)
   - Improve exit message from ControlMaster clients. (bz #1262)
   - Prevent sftp-server(8) from reading until it runs out of buffer
     space, whereupon it would exit with a fatal error. (bz #1286)

 * Portable OpenSSH bugs fixed:

   - Fix multiple inclusion of paths.h on AIX 5.1 systems. (bz #1243)
   - Implement getpeereid for Solaris using getpeerucred. Solaris
     systems will now refuse ssh-agent(1) and ssh(1) ControlMaster
     clients from different, non-root users (bz #1287)
   - Fix compilation warnings by including string.h if found. (bz #1294)
   - Remove redefinition of _res in getrrsetbyname.c for platforms that
     already define it. (bz #1299)
   - Fix spurious "chan_read_failed for istate 3" errors from sshd(8),
     a side-effect of the "hang on exit" fix introduced in 4.6p1.
     (bz #1306)
   - pam_end() was not being called if authentication failed (bz #1322)
   - Fix SELinux support when SELinux is in permissive mode. Previously
     sshd(8) was treating SELinux errors as always fatal. (bz #1325)
   - Ensure that pam_setcred(..., PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED) is called before
     pam_setcred(..., PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED), fixing pam_dhkeys.
     (bz #1339)
   - Fix privilege separation on QNX - pre-auth only, this platform does
     not support file descriptior passing needed for post-auth privilege
     separation. (bz #1343)

Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs and
tested releases.
