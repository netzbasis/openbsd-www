Portable OpenSSH 2.9p2 has just been uploaded and shall be making its
way to the mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/portable.html
shortly.

This release fixes the "cookies" file deletion problem reported on
BUGTRAQ as well as a few other minor (non-security) bugs. No new
features have been added in this release.

Regards,
Damien Miller
