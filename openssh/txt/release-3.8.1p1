OpenSSH 3.8.1p1 was released on 2004-04-19. It is available from 
the mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly. 

This release is a bug-fix release for the portable version. There are
no feature additions and no corresponding OpenBSD-only release.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source, help
with testing and have bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
