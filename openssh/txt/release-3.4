OpenSSH 3.4 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.


Changes since OpenSSH 3.3:
============================ 

Security Changes:
=================

  All versions of OpenSSH's sshd between 2.9.9 and 3.3
  contain an input validation error that can result in
  an integer overflow and privilege escalation.

  OpenSSH 3.4 fixes this bug.

  In addition, OpenSSH 3.4 adds many checks to detect 
  invalid input and mitigate resource exhaustion attacks.

  OpenSSH 3.2 and later prevent privilege escalation
  if UsePrivilegeSeparation is enabled in sshd_config.
  OpenSSH 3.3 enables UsePrivilegeSeparation by
  default.
