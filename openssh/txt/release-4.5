Changes since OpenSSH 4.4:
============================

This is a bugfix only release. No new features have been added.

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * Fix a bug in the sshd privilege separation monitor that weakened its
   verification of successful authentication. This bug is not known to
   be exploitable in the absence of additional vulnerabilities.
 
This release includes the following non-security fixes:

 * Several compilation fixes for portable OpenSSH

 * Fixes to Solaris SMF/process contract support (bugzilla #1255)

Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs and
tested releases.
