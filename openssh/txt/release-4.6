OpenSSH 4.6 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
        http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html and

Changes since OpenSSH 4.5:
============================

 * sshd now allows the enabling and disabling of authentication
   methods on a per user, group, host and network basis via the
   Match directive in sshd_config.

 * The following bugs have been fixed in this release:

   - Clear SIGALRM when restarting due to SIGHUP. Prevents stray
     signal from taking down sshd if a connection was pending at
     the time SIGHUP was received
   - sftp returned a zero exit status when upload failed due to write
     errors (bugzilla #1252)
   - fixed an inconsistent check for a terminal when displaying scp
     progress meter (bugzilla #1265)
   - Parsing of time values in Match blocks was incorrectly applied
     to the global configuration (bugzilla #1275)
   - Allow multiple forwarding options to work when specified in a
     PermitOpen directive (bugzilla #1267)
   - Interoperate with ssh.com versions that do not support binding
     remote port forwarding sessions to a hostname (bugzilla #1019)

 * Portable OpenSSH bugs fixed:

   - "hang on exit" when background processes are running at the time
     of exit on a ttyful/login session (bugzilla #52)
   - Fix typos in the ssh-rand-helper(8) man page (bugzilla #1259)
   - Check that some SIG records have been returned in getrrsetbyname
     (bugzilla #1281)
   - Fix contrib/findssl for platforms that lack "which" (bugzilla 
     #1237)
   - Work around bug in OpenSSL 0.9.8e that broke aes256-ctr,
     aes192-ctr, arcfour256 (bugzilla #1291)
