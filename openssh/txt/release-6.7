OpenSSH 6.7 was released on 2014-10-06. It is available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:

Changes since OpenSSH 6.6
=========================

Potentially-incompatible changes

 * sshd(8): The default set of ciphers and MACs has been altered to
   remove unsafe algorithms. In particular, CBC ciphers and arcfour*
   are disabled by default.

   The full set of algorithms remains available if configured
   explicitly via the Ciphers and MACs sshd_config options.

 * sshd(8): Support for tcpwrappers/libwrap has been removed.

 * OpenSSH 6.5 and 6.6 have a bug that causes ~0.2% of connections
   using the curve25519-sha256@libssh.org KEX exchange method to fail
   when connecting with something that implements the specification
   correctly. OpenSSH 6.7 disables this KEX method when speaking to
   one of the affected versions.

New Features

 * Major internal refactoring to begin to make part of OpenSSH usable
   as a library. So far the wire parsing, key handling and KRL code
   has been refactored. Please note that we do not consider the API
   stable yet, nor do we offer the library in separable form.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Add support for Unix domain socket forwarding.
   A remote TCP port may be forwarded to a local Unix domain socket
   and vice versa or both ends may be a Unix domain socket.

 * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): Add support for SSHFP DNS records for
   ED25519 key types.

 * sftp(1): Allow resumption of interrupted uploads.

 * ssh(1): When rekeying, skip file/DNS lookups of the hostkey if it
   is the same as the one sent during initial key exchange; bz#2154

 * sshd(8): Allow explicit ::1 and 127.0.0.1 forwarding bind
   addresses when GatewayPorts=no; allows client to choose address
   family; bz#2222

 * sshd(8): Add a sshd_config PermitUserRC option to control whether
   ~/.ssh/rc is executed, mirroring the no-user-rc authorized_keys
   option; bz#2160

 * ssh(1): Add a %C escape sequence for LocalCommand and ControlPath
   that expands to a unique identifer based on a hash of the tuple of
   (local host, remote user, hostname, port). Helps avoid exceeding
   miserly pathname limits for Unix domain sockets in multiplexing
   control paths; bz#2220

 * sshd(8): Make the "Too many authentication failures" message
   include the user, source address, port and protocol in a format
   similar to the authentication success / failure messages; bz#2199

 * Added unit and fuzz tests for refactored code. These are run
   automatically in portable OpenSSH via the "make tests" target.

Bugfixes

 * sshd(8): Fix remote forwarding with the same listen port but
   different listen address.

 * ssh(1): Fix inverted test that caused PKCS#11 keys that were
   explicitly listed in ssh_config or on the commandline not to be
   preferred.

 * ssh-keygen(1): Fix bug in KRL generation: multiple consecutive
   revoked certificate serial number ranges could be serialised to an
   invalid format. Readers of a broken KRL caused by this bug will
   fail closed, so no should-have-been-revoked key will be accepted.

 * ssh(1): Reflect stdio-forward ("ssh -W host:port ...") failures in
   exit status. Previously we were always returning 0; bz#2255

 * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): Make Ed25519 keys' title fit properly in the
   randomart border; bz#2247

 * ssh-agent(1): Only cleanup agent socket in the main agent process
   and not in any subprocesses it may have started (e.g. forked
   askpass). Fixes agent sockets being zapped when askpass processes
   fatal(); bz#2236

 * ssh-add(1): Make stdout line-buffered; saves partial output getting
   lost when ssh-add fatal()s part-way through (e.g. when listing keys
   from an agent that supports key types that ssh-add doesn't);
   bz#2234

 * ssh-keygen(1): When hashing or removing hosts, don't choke on
   @revoked markers and don't remove @cert-authority markers; bz#2241

 * ssh(1): Don't fatal when hostname canonicalisation fails and a
   ProxyCommand is in use; continue and allow the ProxyCommand to
   connect anyway (e.g. to a host with a name outside the DNS behind
   a bastion)

 * scp(1): When copying local->remote fails during read, don't send
   uninitialised heap to the remote end.

 * sftp(1): Fix fatal "el_insertstr failed" errors when tab-completing
   filenames with  a single quote char somewhere in the string;
   bz#2238

 * ssh-keyscan(1): Scan for Ed25519 keys by default.

 * ssh(1): When using VerifyHostKeyDNS with a DNSSEC resolver, down-
   convert any certificate keys to plain keys and attempt SSHFP
   resolution.  Prevents a server from skipping SSHFP lookup and
   forcing a new-hostkey dialog by offering only certificate keys.
     
 * sshd(8): Avoid crash at exit via NULL pointer reference; bz#2225

 * Fix some strict-alignment errors.

Portable OpenSSH

 * Portable OpenSSH now supports building against libressl-portable.

 * Portable OpenSSH now requires openssl 0.9.8f or greater. Older
   versions are no longer supported.

 * In the OpenSSL version check, allow fix version upgrades (but not
   downgrades. Debian bug #748150.

 * sshd(8): On Cygwin, determine privilege separation user at runtime,
   since it may need to be a domain account.

 * sshd(8): Don't attempt to use vhangup on Linux. It doesn't work for
   non-root users, and for them it just messes up the tty settings.

 * Use CLOCK_BOOTTIME in preference to CLOCK_MONOTONIC when it is
   available. It considers time spent suspended, thereby ensuring
   timeouts (e.g. for expiring agent keys) fire correctly.  bz#2228

 * Add support for ed25519 to opensshd.init init script.

 * sftp-server(8): On platforms that support it, use prctl() to
   prevent sftp-server from accessing /proc/self/{mem,maps}
