OpenSSH 2.9.9 has just been uploaded. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.

OpenSSH 2.9.9 fixes a weakness in the key file option handling,
including source IP based access control.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

This release contains many portability bug-fixes (listed in the
ChangeLog) as well as several new features (listed below).

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Security Notes:
===============

This release fixes weakness in the source IP based access control
for SSH protocol v2 public key authentication:

        Versions of OpenSSH between 2.5 and 2.9.9 are
        affected if they use the 'from=' key file option in
        combination with both RSA and DSA keys in
        ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2.

        Depending on the order of the user keys in
        ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 sshd might fail to apply the
        source IP based access control restriction (e.g.
        from="10.0.0.1") to the correct key:

        If a source IP restricted key (e.g. DSA key) is
        immediately followed by a key of a different type
        (e.g. RSA key), then key options for the second key
        are applied to both keys, which includes 'from='.

	This means that users can circumvent the system policy
	and login from disallowed source IP addresses.
	

Important Changes:
==================

OpenSSH 2.9.9 might have upgrade issues introduced by the long time
between releases, which may affect people in unforseen ways:

1) The files
	/etc/ssh_known_hosts2
	~/.ssh/known_hosts2
	~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
   are now obsolete, you can use
	/etc/ssh_known_hosts
	~/.ssh/known_hosts
	~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   For backward compatibility ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 is still used for
   authentication and hostkeys are still read from the known_hosts2.
   However, old files are considered 'readonly'.  Future releases are
   likely to not read these files.

2) The CheckMail option in sshd_config is deprecated, sshd no longer
   checks for new mail.

3) X11 cookies are stored in $HOME
