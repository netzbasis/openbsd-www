OpenSSH 3.8 was released on 2004-02-24. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
        http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html#18

Changes since OpenSSH 3.7.1:
============================ 

* sshd(8) now supports forced changes of expired passwords via
  /usr/bin/passwd or keyboard-interactive authentication.

  Note for AIX: sshd will now deny password access to accounts with
  passwords expired longer than their maxexpired attribute.  For
  details, see the AIX section in README.platform.

* ssh(1) now uses untrusted cookies for X11-Forwarding.
  Some X11 applications might need full access to the X11 server,
  see ForwardX11Trusted in ssh(1) and xauth(1) for more information.

* ssh(1) now supports sending application layer
  keep-alive messages to the server.  See ServerAliveInterval
  in ssh(1) for more information.

* Improved sftp(1) batch file support.

* New KerberosGetAFSToken option for sshd(8).

* Updated /etc/moduli file and improved performance for
  protocol version 2.

* Support for host keys in DNS (draft-ietf-secsh-dns-xx.txt).
  Please see README.dns in the source distribution for details.

* Fix a number of memory leaks.

* The experimental "gssapi" support has been replaced with
  the "gssapi-with-mic" to fix possible MITM attacks.
  The two versions are not compatible.
