OpenSSH 3.1 was released on 2004-04-09. It is available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.


Important Changes:
==================

- /etc/ssh/ now default directory for keys and configuration files
- ssh-keygen no longer defaults to a specific key type (rsa1);
  use ssh-keygen -t {rsa,dsa,rsa1}
- sshd x11 forwarding listens on localhost by default;
  see sshd X11UseLocalhost option to revert to prior behaviour
  if your older X11 clients do not function with this configuration


Other Changes:
==============

- ssh ~& escape char functions now for both protocol versions
- sshd ReverseMappingCheck option changed to VerifyReverseMapping
  to clarify its function; ReverseMappingCheck can still be used
- public key fingerprint is now logged with LogLevel=VERBOSE
- reason logged for disallowed logins (e.g., no shell, etc.)
- more robust error handling for x11 forwarding
- improved packet/window size handling in ssh2
- use of regex(3) has been removed
- fix SIGCHLD races in sshd (seen on Solaris)
- sshd -o option added
- sftp -B -R -P options added
- ssh-add now adds all 3 default keys
- ssh-keyscan bug fixes
- ssh-askpass for hostkey dialog
- fix fd leak in sshd on SIGHUP
- TCP_NODELAY set on X11 and TCP forwarding endpoints
