OpenSSH 6.0 was released on 2012-04-22. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the

Changes since OpenSSH 5.9
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Features:

 * ssh-keygen(1): Add optional checkpoints for moduli screening
 * ssh-add(1): new -k option to load plain keys (skipping certificates)
 * sshd(8): Add wildcard support to PermitOpen, allowing things like
   "PermitOpen localhost:*".  bz #1857
 * ssh(1): support for cancelling local and remote port forwards via the
   multiplex socket. Use ssh -O cancel -L xx:xx:xx -R yy:yy:yy user@host"
   to request the cancellation of the specified forwardings
 * support cancellation of local/dynamic forwardings from ~C commandline

Bugfixes:

 * ssh(1): ensure that $DISPLAY contains only valid characters before
   using it to extract xauth data so that it can't be used to play local
   shell metacharacter games.
 * ssh(1): unbreak remote portforwarding with dynamic allocated listen ports
 * scp(1): uppress adding '--' to remote commandlines when the first
   argument does not start with '-'. saves breakage on some
   difficult-to-upgrade embedded/router platforms
 * ssh(1)/sshd(8): fix typo in IPQoS parsing: there is no "AF14" class,
   but there is an "AF21" class
 * ssh(1)/sshd(8): do not permit SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST/ACCEPT during
   rekeying
 * ssh(1): skip attempting to create ~/.ssh when -F is passed
 * sshd(8): unbreak stdio forwarding when ControlPersist is in use; bz#1943
 * sshd(1): send tty break to pty master instead of (probably already
   closed) slave side; bz#1859
 * sftp(1): silence error spam for "ls */foo" in directory with files;
   bz#1683
 * Fixed a number of memory and file descriptor leaks

Portable OpenSSH:

 * Add a new privilege separation sandbox implementation for Linux's
   new seccomp sandbox, automatically enabled on platforms that support
   it. (Note: privilege separation sandboxing is still experimental)
 * Fix compilation problems on FreeBSD, where libutil contained openpty()
   but not login().
 * ssh-keygen(1): don't fail in -A on platforms that don't support ECC
 * Add optional support for LDNS, a BSD licensed DNS resolver library
   which supports DNSSEC
 * Relax OpenSSL version check to allow running OpenSSH binaries on
   systems with OpenSSL libraries with a newer "fix" or "patch" level
   than the binaries were originally compiled on (previous check only
   allowed movement within "patch" releases). bz#1991
 * Fix builds using contributed Redhat spec file. bz#1992
