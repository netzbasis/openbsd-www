This is to announce the release of openssh-2.1.0, the first stable
release of portable OpenSSH to incorporate support for the SSH2
protocol.

The SSH2 protocol offers a number of advantages over the SSH1 protocol
including standards compliance (SSH2 is on the IETF standards
track[1]), improved security and operation without RSA (which is
patented in some countries).

The SSH2 support in OpenSSH has been developed by Markus Friedl, with
support from the OpenBSD team.

This is also the first version of the portable version of OpenSSH
to offer built-in entropy collection. This removes the requirement
for EGD on systems that lack a /dev/random driver. As a result,
OpenSSH-2.1.0 now requires a recent version of OpenSSL[2] to compile
(version 0.9.5 or later).

NB. The portable version of OpenSSH is currently in the
process of merging its webpages with the official OpenBSD
project. Please use http://www.openssh.com/ from now
on. Distribution files are also available from the mirrors listed at
http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/files/MIRRORS.html

Please read http://www.openssh.com/report.html before reporting bugs.
Patches, bug reports, developer and user queries are welcome on the
mailing list (http://www.openssh.com/list.html).

Regards,
Damien Miller
