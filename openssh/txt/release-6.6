OpenSSH 6.6 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
http://www.openssh.com/donations.html

Changes since OpenSSH 6.6
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security:

 * sshd(8): when using environment passing with a sshd_config(5)
   AcceptEnv pattern with a wildcard. OpenSSH prior to 6.6 could be
   tricked into accepting any enviornment variable that contains the
   characters before the wildcard character.

New / changed features:

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): this release removes the J-PAKE authentication code.
   This code was experimental, never enabled and had been unmaintained
   for some time.

 * ssh(1): when processing Match blocks, skip 'exec' clauses other clauses
   predicates failed to match.

 * ssh(1): if hostname canonicalisation is enabled and results in the
   destination hostname being changed, then re-parse ssh_config(5) files
   using the new destination hostname. This gives 'Host' and 'Match'
   directives that use the expanded hostname a chance to be applied.

Bugfixes:

 * ssh(1): avoid spurious "getsockname failed: Bad file descriptor" in
   ssh -W. bz#2200, debian#738692

 * sshd(8): allow the shutdown(2) syscall in seccomp-bpf and systrace
   sandbox modes, as it is reachable if the connection is terminated
   during the pre-auth phase.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix unsigned overflow that in SSH protocol 1 bignum
   parsing. Minimum key length checks render this bug unexploitable to
   compromise SSH 1 sessions.

 * sshd_config(5): clarify behaviour of a keyword that appears in
   multiple matching Match blocks. bz#2184

 * ssh(1): avoid unnecessary hostname lookups when canonicalisation is
   disabled. bz#2205

 * sshd(8): avoid sandbox violation crashes in GSSAPI code by caching
   the supported list of GSSAPI mechanism OIDs before entering the
   sandbox. bz#2107

 * ssh(1): fix possible crashes in SOCKS4 parsing caused by assumption
   that the SOCKS username is nul-terminated.

 * ssh(1): fix regression for UsePrivilegedPort=yes when BindAddress is
   not specified.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix memory leak in ECDSA signature verification.

 * ssh(1): fix matching of 'Host' directives in ssh_config(5) files
   to be case-insensitive again (regression in 6.5).

Portable OpenSSH:

 * sshd(8): don't fatal if the FreeBSD Capsicum is offered by the
   system headers and libc but is not supported by the kernel.
 * Fix build using the HP-UX compiler.

The new key has been signed by the old key to provide continuity. It is
