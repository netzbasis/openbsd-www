OpenSSH 3.2.3 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.


Changes since OpenSSH 3.2.2:
============================ 

  This release fixes several problems in OpenSSH 3.2.2:

    - a defect in the BSD_AUTH access control handling for
      OpenBSD and BSD/OS systems:

      Under certain conditions, on systems using YP with netgroups
      in the password database, it is possible that sshd does ACL
      checks for the requested user name but uses the password
      database entry of a different user for authentication. This
      means that denied users might authenticate successfully while
      permitted users could be locked out (OpenBSD PR 2659).

    - login/tty problems on Solaris (bug #245)

    - build problems on Cygwin systems
