	privilege separation is now enabled by default

  See UsePrivilegeSeparation in sshd_config(5)
  and http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html for more
  information.
- ssh no longer needs to be installed setuid root for protocol
  version 2 hostbased authentication, see ssh-keysign(8).
  protocol version 1 rhosts-rsa authentication still requires privileges
  and is not recommended.
