=========================

General Bugfixes:

 * Do not limit home directory paths to 256 characters. bz#1615

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * This release removes for support for very old versions of Cygwin and
   for Windows 95/98/ME

 * Move the deletion of PAM credentials on logout to after the session
   close. bz#1534

 * Make PrintLastLog work on AIX. bz#1595

 * Avoid compile errors on FreeBSD from conflicts in glob.h. bz#1634

 * Delay dropping of root privileges on AIX so chroot and pam_open_session
   work correctly. bz#1249 and bz#1567

 * Increase client IO buffer on Cygwin to 64K, realising a significant
   performance improvement.
 
 * Roll back bz#1241 (better handling for expired passwords on Tru64).
   The change broke password logins on some configurations.

   rename(). bz#1535

 * Fix passing of variables to recursive make(1) invocations on Solaris.
   bz#1505

   succeeds and can hang if large amounts of data is sent to the slave
   (eg a copy-paste). bz#1528

 * Fix test for server-assigned remote forwarding port for non-root users.
