OpenSSH 7.1 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
http://www.openssh.com/donations.html

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in the next release
including:

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

 * Several ciphers will be disabled by default: blowfish-cbc,
   cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants and the rijndael-cbc aliases
   for AES.

 * MD5-based HMAC algorithms will be disabled by default.

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for OpenSSH 7.2 when it is released.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.0
=========================

This is a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * sshd(8): OpenSSH 7.0 contained a logic error in PermitRootLogin=
   prohibit-password/without-password that could, depending on
   compile-time configuration, permit password authentication to
   root while preventing other forms of authentication. This problem
   was reported by Mantas Mikulenas.

Bugfixes
--------

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): add compatibility workarounds for FuTTY

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): refine compatibility workarounds for WinSCP

 * Fix a number of memory faults (double-free, free of uninitialised
   memory, etc) in ssh(1) and ssh-keygen(1). Reported by Mateusz
   Kocielski.
