OpenSSH 5.0 was released on 2008-04-03. It is available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

We apologise for any inconvenience resulting from this release
being made so shortly after 4.9. Unfortunately we only learned of
the below security issue from the public CVE report. The Debian
OpenSSH maintainers responsible for handling the initial report of
this bug failed to report it via either the private OpenSSH security
contact list (openssh@openssh.com) or the portable OpenSSH Bugzilla
(http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/).

We ask anyone wishing to report security bugs in OpenSSH to please use
the openssh@openssh.com contact and to practice responsible disclosure.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
        http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html and
