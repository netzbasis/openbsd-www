Version 2.2.0p1 of portable OpenSSH has just been uploaded to the
master site and should be making its way to the mirrors in due
course. 

http://www.openssh.com/portable.html

This release contains several new features and bugfixes relative to
the previous 2.1.1p4 release. In particular:

- DSA key support in ssh-agent. Please not that this will not 
  interop with ssh.com's ssh-agent (Markus Friedl)
- sshd now implements Random Early Drop connection rate limiting,
  which can help mitigate DoS attacks against sshd. See the 
  `MaxStartups' option in the sshd manpage for details (Markus Friedl)
- `-u' option to sshd allow logging of hostnames (rather than IP 
  addresses) in wtmp when `UseLogin' is set to `yes'. (Markus Friedl)
- Escape character `~' support in SSH2 (Markus Friedl)
- Interop with SSH.COM ssh 2.3.0 (Markus Friedl)
- Fix problems when sshd is run from inetd
- Better SunOS 4.1.x support (Nate Itkin and Charles Levert)
- Solaris package support, see contrib/solaris (Rip Loomis)
- Work around connection freezes on HPUX and SunOS 4 (Lutz Jaenicke,
  Tamito KAJIYAMA)
- Fix ^C ignored issue on Solaris. (Gert Doering, John Horne and 
  Garrick James)
- Further improved NeXT support. (Ben Lindstrom, Mark Miller)
- Lots of other minor fixes (see ChangeLog for details)

This release has been tested on HPUX (10.20, 11.00), Irix (5.3,
6.5), Linux (Debian, Redhat, Slackware, SuSE), NeXTstep 3 (HPPA,
i386, m68k), OpenStep (i386, m68k, Sparc), SCO Unixware 7.1.0, SCO
OpenServer 5.0.5, Solaris 2.7 (Sparc), Solaris 2.8 (i386, Sparc),
SNI/Reliant Unix, DEC OSF/Tru64 5.0.

Many thanks to those who contributed bug reports, fixes and testing 
time.
