OpenSSH 4.4 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
        http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html and

Changes since OpenSSH 4.3:
============================

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
   that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time
   expired.

 * Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
   handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
   to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
   OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
   pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
   is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
   remote.

 * On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
   be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.

This release includes the following new functionality and fixes:

 * Implemented conditional configuration in sshd_config(5) using the
   "Match" directive. This allows some configuration options to be
   selectively overridden if specific criteria (based on user, group,
   hostname and/or address) are met. So far a useful subset of post-
   authentication options are supported and more are expected to be
   added in future releases.

 * Add support for Diffie-Hellman group exchange key agreement with a
   final hash of SHA256.

 * Added a "ForceCommand" directive to sshd_config(5). Similar to the
   command="..." option accepted in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, this forces
   the execution of the specified command regardless of what the user
   requested. This is very useful in conjunction with the new "Match"
   option.

 * Add a "PermitOpen" directive to sshd_config(5). This mirrors the
   permitopen="..." authorized_keys option, allowing fine-grained
   control over the port-forwardings that a user is allowed to
   establish.

 * Add optional logging of transactions to sftp-server(8).

 * ssh(1) will now record port numbers for hosts stored in
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys when a non-standard port has been requested.

 * Add an "ExitOnForwardFailure" option to cause ssh(1) to exit (with
   a non-zero exit code) when requested port forwardings could not be
   established.

 * Extend sshd_config(5) "SubSystem" declarations to allow the
   specification of command-line arguments.

 * Replacement of all integer overflow susceptible invocations of
   malloc(3) and realloc(3) with overflow-checking equivalents.

 * Many manpage fixes and improvements

 * New portable OpenSSH-specific features:

   - Add optional support for SELinux, controlled using the
     --with-selinux configure option (experimental)

   - Add optional support for Solaris process contracts, enabled
     using the --with-solaris-contracts configure option (experimental)
     This option will also include SMF metadata in Solaris packages
     built using the "make package" target

   - Add optional support for OpenSSL hardware accelerators (engines),
     enabled using the --with-ssl-engine configure option.

 * Bugs from http://bugzilla.mindrot.org fixed:
    #482  - readconf doesn't accept paths with spaces in them.
    #906  - syslog messages from sshd [net] lost.
    #975  - Kerberos authentication timing can leak information
            about account validity.

    #1102 - C program 'write' with zero length hangs.
    #1129 - sshd hangs for command-only invocations due to
            fork/child signals.
    #1131 - error "buffer_append_space:alloc not supported"
    #1138 - Passphrase asked for (but ignored) if key file permissions
            too liberal..

    #1171 - configure can't always figure out LLONG_MAX..
    #1173 - scp reports lost connection for very large files.
    #1177 - Incorrect sshrc file location in Makefile.in.
    #1179 - sshd incorrectly rejects  connections due to IP options.
    #1181 - configure should detect when openssl-0.9.8x needs -ldl.
    #1186 - ssh tries multiple times to open unprotected keys.
    #1188 - keyboard-interactive should not allow retry after
            pam_acct_mgmt fails.
    #1193 - Open ssh will not allow changing of passwords on usernames
            greater than 8 characters..
    #1201 - Bind address information is not specified in command line
            help messages.
    #1203 - configure.ac is missing an open [.
    #1207 - sshd does not clear unsuccessful login count on
            non-interactive logins.

   static analysis tool

 * Fixes to inconsistent pointer checks reported by the Stanford
   SATURN tool
