This is to announce the release of portable openssh-2.3.0p1. This
release includes many new features and bug fixes. This is a
recommended upgrade if you are using 2.2.0p1 or an older release.

Portable OpenSSH is available from one of the many mirrors listed at
http://www.openssh.com/portable.html

Some of the more notable features include:

- Rijndael support for SSH2. Use the "Ciphers" configuration directive 
  to enable it. (Markus Friedl <markus@cvs.openbsd.org>

- Cygwin support (Corinna Vinschen <vinschen@cygnus.com>)

- sftp-server support (Markus Friedl <markus@cvs.openbsd.org>)

- SSH1 single-des support for interop with Cisco routers. This cipher

  or enable it using "Cipher des" in a config file. (Markus Friedl
  <markus@cvs.openbsd.org>

- Support expired password change through PAM (Steve VanDevender's
  <stevev@darkwing.uoregon.edu>)
