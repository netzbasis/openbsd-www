Changes since OpenSSH 6.2
=========================

This release is predominantly a bugfix release:

Features:

 * sshd(8): add ssh-agent(1) support to sshd(8); allows encrypted hostkeys,
   or hostkeys on smartcards.

 * ssh(1)/sshd(8): allow optional time-based rekeying via a second argument
   to the existing RekeyLimit option. RekeyLimit is now supported in
   sshd_config as well as on the client.

 * sshd(8): standardise logging of information during user authentication.

   The presented key/cert and the remote username (if available) is now
   logged in the authentication success/failure message on the same log
   line as the local username, remote host/port and protocol in use.
   Certificates contents and the key fingerprint of the signing CA are
   logged too.

   Including all relevant information on a single line simplifies log
   analysis as it is no longer necessary to relate information scattered
   across multiple log entries.

 * ssh(1): add the ability to query which ciphers, MAC algorithms, key
   types and key exchange methods are supported in the binary.

 * ssh(1): support ProxyCommand=- to allow support cases where stdin and
   stdout already point to the proxy.

 * ssh(1): allow IdentityFile=none

 * ssh(1)/sshd(8): add -E option to ssh and sshd to append debugging logs
   to a specified file instead of stderr or syslog.

 * sftp(1): add support for resuming partial downloads using the "reget"
   command and on the sftp commandline or on the "get" commandline using
   the "-a" (append) option.

 * ssh(1): add an "IgnoreUnknown" configuration option to selectively
   suppress errors arising from unknown configuration directives.

 * sshd(8): add support for submethods to be appended to required
   authentication methods listed via AuthenticationMethods.

Bugfixes:

 * sshd(8): fix refusal to accept certificate if a key of a different type
   to the CA key appeared in authorized_keys before the CA key.

 * ssh(1)/ssh-agent(1)/sshd(8): Use a monotonic time source for timers so
   that things like keepalives and rekeying will work properly over clock
   steps.

 * sftp(1): update progressmeter when data is acknowledged, not when it's
   sent. bz#2108

 * ssh(1)/ssh-keygen(1): improve error messages when the current user does
   not exist in /etc/passwd; bz#2125

 * ssh(1): reset the order in which public keys are tried after partial
   authentication success.

 * ssh-agent(1): clean up socket files after SIGINT when in debug mode;
   bz#2120

 * ssh(1) and others: avoid confusing error messages in the case of broken
   system resolver configurations; bz#2122

 * ssh(1): set TCP nodelay for connections started with -N; bz#2124

 * ssh(1): correct manual for permission requirements on ~/.ssh/config;
   bz#2078

 * ssh(1): fix ControlPersist timeout not triggering in cases where TCP
   connections have hung. bz#1917

 * ssh(1): properly deatch a ControlPersist master from its controlling
   terminal.

 * sftp(1): avoid crashes in libedit when it has been compiled with multi-
   byte character support. bz#1990

 * sshd(8): when running sshd -D, close stderr unless we have explicitly
   requested logging to stderr. bz#1976,

 * ssh(1): fix incomplete bzero; bz#2100

 * sshd(8): log and error and exit if ChrootDirectory is specified and
   running without root privileges.

 * Many improvements to the regression test suite. In particular log files
   are now saved from ssh and sshd after failures.

 * Fix a number of memory leaks. bz#1967 bz#2096 and others

 * sshd(8): fix public key authentication when a :style is appended to
   the requested username.

 * ssh(1): do not fatally exit when attempting to cleanup multiplexing-
   created channels that are incompletely opened. bz#2079

Portable OpenSSH:

 * Major overhaul of contrib/cygwin/README

 * Fix unaligned accesses in umac.c for strict-alignment architectures.
   bz#2101

 * Enable -Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess if the compiler supports it. bz#2100

 * Fix broken incorrect commandline reporting errors. bz#1448

 * Only include SHA256 and ECC-based key exchange methods if libcrypto has
   the required support.

 * Fix crash in SOCKS5 dynamic forwarding code on strict-alignment
   architectures.

 * A number of portability fixes for Android:
   * Don't try to use lastlog on Android; bz#2111
   * Fall back to using openssl's DES_crypt function on platorms that don't
     have a native crypt() function; bz#2112
   * Test for fd_mask, howmany and NFDBITS rather than trying to enumerate
     the plaforms that don't have them. bz#2085
   * Replace S_IWRITE, which isn't standardized, with S_IWUSR, which is.
     bz#2085
   * Add a null implementation of endgrent for platforms that don't have
     it (eg Android) bz#2087
   * Support platforms, such as Android, that lack struct passwd.pw_gecos.
     bz#2086
