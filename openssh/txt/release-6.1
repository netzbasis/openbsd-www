Changes since OpenSSH 6.0
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Features:

 * sshd(8): This release turns on pre-auth sandboxing sshd by default for
   new installs, by setting UsePrivilegeSeparation=sandbox in sshd_config.
 * ssh-keygen(1): Add options to specify starting line number and number of
   lines to process when screening moduli candidates, allowing processing
   of different parts of a candidate moduli file in parallel
 * sshd(8): The Match directive now supports matching on the local (listen)
   address and port upon which the incoming connection was received via
   LocalAddress and LocalPort clauses.
 * sshd(8): Extend sshd_config Match directive to allow setting AcceptEnv
   and {Allow,Deny}{Users,Groups}
 * Add support for RFC6594 SSHFP DNS records for ECDSA key types. bz#1978
 * ssh-keygen(1): Allow conversion of RSA1 keys to public PEM and PKCS8
 * sshd(8): Allow the sshd_config PermitOpen directive to accept "none" as
   an argument to refuse all port-forwarding requests.
 * sshd(8): Support "none" as an argument for AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
 * ssh-keyscan(1): Look for ECDSA keys by default. bz#1971
 * sshd(8): Add "VersionAddendum" to sshd_config to allow server operators
   to append some arbitrary text to the server SSH protocol banner.

Bugfixes:

 * ssh(1)/sshd(8): Don't spin in accept() in situations of file
   descriptor exhaustion. Instead back off for a while.
 * ssh(1)/sshd(8): Remove hmac-sha2-256-96 and hmac-sha2-512-96 MACs as
   they were removed from the specification. bz#2023,
 * sshd(8): Handle long comments in config files better. bz#2025
 * ssh(1): Delay setting tty_flag so RequestTTY options are correctly
   picked up. bz#1995
 * sshd(8): Fix handling of /etc/nologin incorrectly being applied to root
   on platforms that use login_cap.

Portable OpenSSH:

 * sshd(8): Allow sshd pre-auth sandboxing to fall-back to the rlimit
   sandbox from the Linux SECCOMP filter sandbox when the latter is
   not available in the kernel.
 * ssh(1): Fix NULL dereference when built with LDNS and using DNSSEC to
   retrieve a CNAME SSHFP record.
 * Fix cross-compilation problems related to pkg-config. bz#1996
