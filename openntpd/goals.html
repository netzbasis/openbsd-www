Goals
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Our goal is to make NTP ubiquitous by providing a free simple implementation
that is secure and easy to configure.

<ul>
<li>Be as <strong>secure</strong> as possible. Code carefully, do strict
    validity checks especially in the network input path, and use
    bounded buffer operations. Use privilege separation to mitigate
    the effects of possible security bugs.

<li>Provide a <strong>lean</strong> implementation, sufficient for a
    majority.  Don't try to support each and every obscure usage
    case, but cover the typical ones.

<li>Try to <strong>"Just Work"</strong> in the background.

<li>Work with just a <strong>minimum of configuration</strong>.

<li>Interoperate in the best possible way with the
    <a href="https://www.pool.ntp.org/en/">NTP pools</a>
    cluster, by supporting DNS lookups safely.

<li>Reach a <strong>reasonable accuracy</strong>. Do not sacrifice secure
    design for getting that last nanosecond or obscure edge case.

</ul>
