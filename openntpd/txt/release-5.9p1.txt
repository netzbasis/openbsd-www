OpenNTPD 5.9p1 has just been released. It will be available from the mirrors
listed at http://www.openntpd.org/ shortly.

OpenNTPD is a FREE, secure, and easy to use implementation of the Network Time
Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote NTP servers
and can act as NTP server itself, redistributing the local clock.

Changes since OpenNTPD 5.7p4
============================
* When a single "constraint" is specified, try all returned addresses
  until one succeeds, rather than the first returned address.
* Relaxed the constraint error margin to be proportional to the number
  of NTP peers, avoid constant reconnections when there is a bad NTP
  peer.
* Removed disabled hotplug sensor support.
* Added support for detecting crashes in constraint subprocesses.
* Moved the execution of constraints from the ntp process to the
  parent process, allowing for better privilege separation since the
  ntp process can be further restricted.
* Added pledge(2) support.
* Updated to require LibreSSL 2.3.2 or greater.
* Fixed high CPU usage when the network is down.
* Fixed various memory leaks.
* Switched to RMS for jitter calculations.
* Unified logging functions with other OpenBSD base programs.

OpenNTPD portable-specific changes:

* Added support for syncing time with the Realtime Clock (RTC) on OSes
  that require it.
* CFLAGS is no longer overridden by the build system.
* FreeBSD RTABLE support is disabled
* FreeBSD is no longer linked with -lmd to avoid hash function
  collisions, causing failures in constraint certificate loading.
* Fixed crashes due to __progname being used before initialized.
* Added Solaris 10 compatibility.
* Added --disable-https-constraint build option for explicitly
  disabling constraint support.
* Synced build system files with LibreSSL

The libtls library, as shipped with LibreSSL 2.3.2 or later, is
required to use the HTTPS constraint feature, though it is not
required to use OpenNTPD.

For detailed changes, see the changes either in the OpenBSD CVS repository or
the GitHub mirror.
