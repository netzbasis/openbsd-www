OpenNTPD 6.2p3 has just been released, which is based on the final OpenBSD 6.2 release.
It will be available from the mirrors listed at http://www.openntpd.org/ shortly.

OpenNTPD is a FREE, secure, and easy to use implementation of the Network Time
Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote NTP servers
and can act as NTP server itself, redistributing the local clock.

Changes since OpenNTPD 6.2p1
============================

    * Fixed support for the 'query from <ip>' directive and clarified its usage.

Changes since OpenNTPD 6.2p2
============================

    * Fixed support for macOS

The libtls library, as shipped with LibreSSL 2.6.0 or later, is
required to use the HTTPS constraint feature, though it is not
required to use OpenNTPD.

For detailed changes, see the changes either in the OpenBSD CVS repository or
the GitHub mirror.
