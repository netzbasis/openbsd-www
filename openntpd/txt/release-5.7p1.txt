OpenNTPD 5.7p1 has just been released. It will be available from the mirrors
listed at http://www.openntpd.org/ shortly.

OpenNTPD is a FREE, secure, and easy to use implementation of the Network Time
Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote NTP servers
and can act as NTP server itself, redistributing the local clock. 

Changes since OpenNTPD 3.9p1
==========================

After a long hiatus, the latest version of OpenNTPD is available once again in
a portable release.

 * Support for a new build infrastructure based on the LibreSSL framework.
   Source code is integrated directly from the OpenBSD tree with few manual
   changes, easing maintenance.
 * Removed support for several OSes pending test reports and updated
   portability code.
 * Supports the Simple Network Time Protocol version 4 as described in RFC 5905
 * Added route virtualization (rdomain) support.
 * Added ntpctl(8), which allows for querying ntpd(8) at runtime.
 * Finer-grained clock adjustment via adjfreq / ntp_adjtime where available.
 * Improved latency on heavily-loaded machines.

For detailed changes, see the changes either in the OpenBSD CVS repository or
the GitHub mirror.
