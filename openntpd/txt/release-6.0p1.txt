OpenNTPD 6.0p1 has just been released. It will be available from the mirrors
listed at http://www.openntpd.org/ shortly.

OpenNTPD is a FREE, secure, and easy to use implementation of the Network Time
Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote NTP servers
and can act as NTP server itself, redistributing the local clock.

Changes since OpenNTPD 5.9p1
============================

    * Fixed a link failure on older Linux distributions and a build
      failure on FreeBSD.
    * Set MOD_MAXERROR to avoid unsynced time status when using
      ntp_adjtime.
    * Fixed HTTP Timestamp header parsing to use strptime in a more
      portable fashion.
    * Hardened TLS for ntpd constraints, enabling server name
      verification. Thanks to Luis M. Merino.

The libtls library, as shipped with LibreSSL 2.3.2 or later, is
required to use the HTTPS constraint feature, though it is not
required to use OpenNTPD.

For detailed changes, see the changes either in the OpenBSD CVS repository or
the GitHub mirror.
