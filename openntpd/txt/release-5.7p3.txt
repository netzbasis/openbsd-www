OpenNTPD 5.7p3 has just been released. It will be available from the mirrors
listed at http://www.openntpd.org/ shortly.

OpenNTPD is a FREE, secure, and easy to use implementation of the Network Time
Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote NTP servers
and can act as NTP server itself, redistributing the local clock. 

Changes since OpenNTPD 5.7p2
============================
* Fixed issue resolving hostnames when the network is initially unavailable.
* Fixed process name logging on Linux and OS X.
* Fixed adjfreq failures on Solaris due to uninitialized struct timex.
* Support building on Linux musl libc.
* Default privilege separation directory changed from /var/empty/ntp
  to /var/empty. Please ensure that if you are using the default from
  previous releases that the privsep directory is empty, owned by
  root, and has no write privileges for other users.

For detailed changes, see the changes either in the OpenBSD CVS repository or
the GitHub mirror.
