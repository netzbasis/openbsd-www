OpenNTPD 6.1p1 has just been released. It will be available from the mirrors
listed at http://www.openntpd.org/ shortly.

OpenNTPD is a FREE, secure, and easy to use implementation of the Network Time
Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote NTP servers
and can act as NTP server itself, redistributing the local clock.

Changes since OpenNTPD 6.0p1
============================

    * Quieted warnings about constraint connection retries.

    * Implemented fork+exec for ntpd child processes.

    * Added imsg inter-process reliability fixes.

    * Fixed memory leaks and reduced heap memory usage.

    * Numerous logging improvements and additions.

    * Added macOS 10.12 getentropy support.

    * Fixed arc4random blacklist use native implementations where
      possible.

The libtls library, as shipped with LibreSSL 2.5.0 or later, is
required to use the HTTPS constraint feature, though it is not
required to use OpenNTPD.

For detailed changes, see the changes either in the OpenBSD CVS repository or
the GitHub mirror.
