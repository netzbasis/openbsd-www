OpenNTPD 5.7p4 has just been released. It will be available from the mirrors
listed at http://www.openntpd.org/ shortly.

OpenNTPD is a FREE, secure, and easy to use implementation of the Network Time
Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote NTP servers
and can act as NTP server itself, redistributing the local clock.

Changes since OpenNTPD 5.7p3
============================
* Added support for using HTTPS time constraints to validate NTP responses.
  You can find a detailed description of the feature and how it works here:
    http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=142356166731390&w=2
  See the man page and example config file for configuration details.
* Workaround a bug in the Solaris adjtime call that caused the olddelta to
  never reach 0, leading to continual sync/unsync messages from ntpd.
* Workaround an overflow on systems with 32-bit time_t. This can result in a
  failure to set the time if the initial clock is set later than early 2036.
  Systems with a 32-bit time_t should upgrade well in advance of this date, but
  today this helps with systems that boot with an invalid initial time.

The libtls library, as shipped with LibreSSL 2.1.4 or later, is
required to use the HTTPS constraint feature, though it is not
required to use OpenNTPD.

This marks the last release based on the OpenBSD 5.7 tree.
The next release will be OpenNTPD 5.8p1.

For detailed changes, see the changes either in the OpenBSD CVS repository or
the GitHub mirror.
