User Groups
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
The continuing growth of OpenBSD depends on attracting new
users, developers, software suppliers,
and consultants. One means of reaching new users is via users groups,
where people can exchange experiences, ideas, free software, and find
out that there are others with similar problems and solutions.

<p>
The following user groups are either specific to OpenBSD or
at least to the BSD family of systems.
However, the OpenBSD Project does not necessarily endorse any of these.
Please contact the User's Group directly.

<p>
These entries are arranged geographically by country,
so that you may more readily find
a users' group near you.

<p>
paste(groups.countries)

<p>
If you want to see your group listed, the format is quite rigid; please use
<a href="grp-tmpl.txt">this template</a> (do not just
copy and paste plain text from your browser!).
When you think it's ready, mail it to
<em>misc at openbsd.org</em>,
with a Subject: line containing the word "groups"
<em>and</em> either the word "new" or "update".

<table>
<!-- This TR sets up the table format -->
<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Group Name/<br>Contact Person
	<th>City/<br>Province
	<th>When Meeting
	<th>Email<br>URL
	<th>Type of group

<!-- THIS TABLE IS MECHANICALLY GENERATED ** DO NOT EDIT.
 **  INSTEAD, RTFM ABOVE, UPDATE support.dat in ./build CAREFULLY and "make".
 **  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE COMMIT ACCESS, MAIL ME YOUR CHANGES, IN THE FORM
 **  OF "SUPPORT.TEMPLATE" PLEASE.
