<p id=prospective>
To be listed on this page we require mirrors to be fast, up-to-date,
capable, and well-connected to networks in the region in which they serve.
Our policy requires mirrors to carry at least the last two releases in
binary form (currently 6.0 and 5.9), snapshots, as well as the other
associated directories (including OpenSSH/, OpenNTPD/, OpenBGPD/,
patches/ and tools/), and keep them current; snapshots should not be
older than a week.
Use the rsync options "--delete-delay", "--delay-updates" and "--fuzzy"
when updating your mirror.
Note that in the above, "release" means <b>all files</b> under the specific
directory.
This includes all architecture subdirectories and the complete packages
subdirectory, with packages for all application architectures.
As of 6.0, the minimum space required is approximately 500GB.
Depending on the disk space available, mirrors may provide more contents,
such as older releases, current source tree, etc.

A suggested <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=httpd.conf&amp;sektion=5">httpd.conf(5)</a>
configuration for <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=httpd&amp;sektion=5">httpd(8)</a>
that is suitable for being www and ftp space mirror is <a href="httpd.conf">here</a>.
<p>
Operators of mirrors who are interested in having their site added to
the list on this page should contact <a
href="mailto:mirrors-discuss@openbsd.org">mirrors-discuss@openbsd.org</a>
with further details about their site, including network connectivity,
geographic location, and general information.
We will suggest a suitable second-level mirror to sync from;
<b>do not</b> mirror from ftp.openbsd.org.
<p>
Mirror operators should subscribe to the low-volume
<a href="mail.html#Mirrors">mirrors-announce</a> mailing list.
