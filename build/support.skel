OpenBSD has attracted a critical mass of developers, support organizations
and consultants such that it is now safe to commit to using OpenBSD in your
projects. The following individuals and organizations have indicated that
they are able to provide support as indicated. However, the OpenBSD Project
does not necessarily endorse any of these. Please contact each site directly.

<p>
These entries are arranged geographically by country, so that you can find
a consultant near you.

paste(support.countries)

<p>
If you want to submit your own entry, the format is quite rigid; please use
<a href="supp-tmpl.txt">this template</a>. Do not just copy and paste plain
text from your browser!
If you want your website to be listed, make sure it can actually be viewed
on OpenBSD, and does not require any proprietary software.
When you think your entry is ready, mail it to <em>misc at openbsd.org</em>,
with a Subject: line containing the word "support"
<i>and</i> either the word "new" or "update."
Note that we may at any time, and without notification, remove your entry
if it is found to be inaccurate, if your website is broken, or if there
is no mention of OpenBSD on it.
If this happens, just re-submit your entry after the situation is corrected
if you want to be listed again.

<!-- THIS TABLE IS MECHANICALLY GENERATED ** DO NOT EDIT.
 **  INSTEAD, RTFM ABOVE, UPDATE support.dat in ./build CAREFULLY and "make".
 **  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE COMMIT ACCESS, MAIL ME YOUR CHANGES.
