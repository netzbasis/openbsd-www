TTL Security Mechanism specified in RFC 3682.
<li>Multiple, independent routing tables, with
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a>
acting as selector.
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/route.8">route(8)</a>

can now expire table entries.
<li><i>keep state</i> is now the default for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf.5">pf.conf(5)</a> rules, as is the <i>flags S/SA</i> option on TCP connections. <i>no state</i> and <i>flags any</i> can be used to disable stateful filtering or TCP flags checking.
<li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a> ruleset optimiser can be enabled in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf.5">pf.conf(5)</a>.
<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> anchors can now be loaded inline in the main <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf.5">pf.conf(5)</a> and can be printed recursively.
<li>Allow
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a>
    rules inside anchors to have their counters reset, and make counter read
    &amp; reset an atomic operation.
<li>
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sensorsd.8">sensorsd(8)</a>
dampens status changes now, thus not alerting for a single wrong sensor read, since many

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spamd.8">spamd(8)</a> and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spamlogd.8">spamlogd(8)</a> now support synchronisation of the greylist database across multiple hosts. The greytrapping mechanism now allows for whole domain traps, and noticing out of order MX use.
<li>
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spamd.8">spamd(8)</a> database format has changed from DB_BTREE to DB_HASH for much better performance on large installations with big databases.
<li>
The
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bridge.4">bridge(4)</a> driver and the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/brconfig.8">brconfig(8)</a> tool now support
the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP).
The new RSTP mode is now used by default when enabled with the <em>stp</em> option.
<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cd.4">cd(4)</a> now supports reading from region protected DVDs.
<li>Detect
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount_msdos.8">MS-DOS filesystems</a>
and spoof disklabel partitions for them even when there is no MBR, e.g. on some newer iPods.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Assorted improvements and code cleanup:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fsck_ffs.8">fsck_ffs(8)</a>
command has been improved to be more robust to various forms of inode and
superblock corruption.
<li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/top.1">top(1)</a>
command got some new ways of filtering the display.
<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pthreads.3">pthreads(3)</a>
file descriptor handling has been improved to eliminate several race and deadlock conditions and improve performance.
<li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount_msdos.8">MS-DOS filesystem</a>
has had a potential corruption issue fixed, and is more reliable when given
a corrupted filesystem to mount.
<li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount_msdos.8">MS-DOS filesystem</a>
and the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/i386/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a>
command have been enhanced to work on devices with 2048 byte sectors,
e.g. newer iPods.
<li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rcs.1">OpenRCS</a> tools
are smarter at handling files, especially when dealing with binary files.
GNU RCS compatibility has also been improved.
<li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1">mg(1)</a>
editor now displays column numbers in the status bar.  It has also
received several improvements which make it more reliable: line
numbers, file insertions, and search wrapping all now work as
expected.
<li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/systat.1">systat(1)</a>
command has a cleaner look, and a display was added for hardware sensors.
<li>The <a href="alpha.html">OpenBSD/alpha</a> platform now uses gcc3.
<li>Improved support for usb attached cd drives and ever more odd
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/umass.4">umass(4)</a>
devices.
<li>Don't treat NetBSD or FreeBSD MBR partitions as substitutes for an OpenBSD partition. i.e. don't try to boot from them or use them to store OpenBSD disklabels.
</ul>
<p>

<li>Install/Upgrade process changes:
<ul>
<li>More reliable detection of disk and cd devices.
<li>More reliable installation from MSDOS FAT partitions.
<li>New sanity check in case sets for the wrong architecture are selected.
<li>No need to specify the filesystem types of source partitions during disk
    or cd installs.
<li>No need to select a source partition during disk or cd installs when
    there is only one to choose from.
</ul>
<p>

<li>OpenBGPD 4.1:
<ul>
<li>Fixes for sessions with tcp md5sig and ipsec. Now sessions can be migrated
    from and to any form of ipsec and tcpmd5 with just a simple
    <em>bgpctl reload</em>, and the session migrates the next time it gets
    established.
<li>Include file support in the config parser.
<li>Can now use the new IP_MINTTL socket option to implement the ttl security
    mechanism.
</ul>
<p>

<li>OpenOSPFD 4.1:
<ul>
<li>Reload support added. It is no longer needed to restart ospfd after a
    configuration change.
<li>Multiple networks per interface are now supported.
<li>It is now possible to specify the route metric and type for each
    redistribution rule.
</ul>
<p>

<li>OpenNTPD 4.1:
<ul>
<li>Greatly improved support for timedelta sensors.
<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ntpd.8">ntpd</a>
    now uses a strictly monotonically increasing time (uptime, basically)
    for its internal timers, so setting the system clock doesn't influence
    query rates, trust levels, etc. any more.
</ul>
<p>

<li>OpenSSH 4.6:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd</a>
    now allows the enabling and disabling of authentication
    methods on a per user, group, host and network basis via the
    <em>Match</em> directive in
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>.
</ul>
<p>

<li>Over 4200 ports, 4000 pre-built packages (for i386), minor robustness improvements
in package tools. Some highlights:
<ul>
<li>gstreamer-0.10 tools.
<li>OpenOffice.org package, available through ftp for size reasons.
<li>KDE 3.5.6 and koffice 1.6.2.
<li>a large (&gt; 500) number of new/updated perl modules, from CPAN, including

<h3>How to install</h3>

<p>
Following this are the instructions which you would have on a piece of
paper if you had purchased a CDROM set instead of doing an alternate
form of install.  The instructions for doing an FTP (or other style
of) install are very similar; the CDROM instructions are left intact
so that you can see how much easier it would have been if you had
purchased a CDROM instead.
<p>

<hr>
Please refer to the following files on the three CDROMs or FTP mirror for

<section id=quickinstall>

<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the
use of the "disklabel -E" command.  If you are at all confused when
installing OpenBSD, read the relevant INSTALL.* file as listed above!

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
Play with your BIOS options to enable booting from a CD. The OpenBSD/i386
release is on CD1. If your BIOS does not support booting from CD, you will need
to create a boot floppy to install from. To create a boot floppy write
<i>CD1:4.1/i386/floppy41.fs</i> to a floppy and boot via the floppy drive.

<p>
Use <i>CD1:4.1/i386/floppyB41.fs</i> instead for greater SCSI controller
support, or <i>CD1:4.1/i386/floppyC41.fs</i> for better laptop support.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD or a floppy disk,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<p>
To make a boot floppy under MS-DOS, use the &quot;rawrite&quot; utility located
at <i>CD1:4.1/tools/rawrite.exe</i>. To make the boot floppy under a Unix OS,
use the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dd.1">dd(1)</a>
utility. The following is an example usage of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dd.1">dd(1)</a>,
where the device could be &quot;floppy&quot;, &quot;rfd0c&quot;, or
&quot;rfd0a&quot;.

<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>dd if=&lt;file&gt; of=/dev/&lt;device&gt; bs=32k</strong>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Make sure you use properly formatted perfect floppies with NO BAD BLOCKS or
your install will most likely fail. For more information on creating a boot
floppy and installing OpenBSD/i386 please refer to
<a href="faq/faq4.html#MkFlop">this page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
The 4.1 release of OpenBSD/amd64 is located on CD2.
Boot from the CD to begin the install - you may need to adjust
your BIOS options first.
If you can't boot from the CD, you can create a boot floppy to install from.
To do this, write <i>CD2:4.1/amd64/floppy41.fs</i> to a floppy, then
boot from the floppy drive.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD or a floppy disk,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Put CD2 in your CDROM drive and poweron your machine while holding down the
<i>C</i> key until the display turns on and shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/4.1/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc:</h3>

<p>
The 4.1 release of OpenBSD/sparc is located on CD3. To boot off of this CD you
can use one of the two commands listed below, depending on the version of your
ROM.

<blockquote><pre>
ok <kbd>boot cdrom 4.1/sparc/bsd.rd</kbd>
or
> <kbd>b sd(0,6,0)4.1/sparc/bsd.rd</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If your SPARC system does not have a CD drive, you can alternatively boot from floppy.
To do so you need to write <i>CD3:4.1/sparc/floppy41.fs</i> to a floppy.
For more information see <a href="faq/faq4.html#MkFlop">this page</a>.
To boot from the floppy use one of the two commands listed below,
depending on the version of your ROM.

<blockquote><pre>
ok <kbd>boot floppy</kbd>
or
> <kbd>b fd()</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
If your SPARC system doesn't have a floppy drive nor a CD drive, you can either
setup a bootable tape, or install via network, as told in the
INSTALL.sparc file.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Put CD3 in your CDROM drive and type <i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>CD3:4.1/sparc64/floppy41.fs</i> or <i>CD3:4.1/sparc64/floppyB41.fs</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>CD3:4.1/sparc64/miniroot41.fs</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>FTP:4.1/alpha/floppy41.fs</i> or
<i>FTP:4.1/alpha/floppyB41.fs</i> (depending on your machine) to a diskette and
enter <i>boot dva0</i>. Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<h3>OpenBSD/armish:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, Thecus can boot directly from the network
either tftp or http. Configure the network using fconfig, reset,
then load bsd.rd, see INSTALL.armish for specific details.
IOData HDL-G can only boot from an EXT-2 partition. Boot into linux
and copy 'boot' and bsd.rd into the first partition on wd0 (hda1)
then load and run bsd.rd, preserving the wd0i (hda1) ext2fs partition.
More details are available in INSTALL.armish.

<h3>OpenBSD/hp300:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hp300.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>CD3:4.1/landisk/miniroot41.fs</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy bsd.rd to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot it from the PROM.
Alternatively, you can create a bootable tape and boot from it. Refer to
the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/mac68k:</h3>

<p>
Boot MacOS as normal and extract the Macside "BSD/Mac68k Booter" utility from
<i>FTP:4.1/mac68k/utils</i> onto your hard disk.  Configure the "BSD/Mac68k
Booter" with the location of your bsd.rd kernel and boot into the installer.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.mac68k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/mvme68k:</h3>

<p>
You can create a bootable installation tape or boot over the network.<br>
The network boot requires a MVME68K BUG version that supports the <i>NIOT</i>
and <i>NBO</i> debugger commands. Follow the instructions in INSTALL.mvme68k
for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sgi:</h3>

<p>
Burn cd41.iso on a CD-R, put it in the CD drive of your machine and
select <i>Install System Software</i> from the System Maintenance menu.

<p>
If your machine doesn't have a CD drive, you can
setup a DHCP/tftp network server, and boot using "bootp()/bsd.rd".
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/vax:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network via mopbooting as described in INSTALL.vax.

<h3>OpenBSD/zaurus:</h3>

<p>
Using the Linux built-in graphical ipkg installer, install the
openbsd41_arm.ipk package.  Reboot, then run it.  Read INSTALL.zaurus
for a few important details.

<h3>Notes about the source code:</h3>

<p>
src.tar.gz contains a source archive starting at /usr/src.  This file
contains everything you need except for the kernel sources, which are
in a separate archive.  To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
sys.tar.gz contains a source archive starting at /usr/src/sys.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</strong>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 4.0 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade41.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.

<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
# <kbd>cd ports</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> subdirectory is a checkout of the OpenBSD ports tree.  Go
read the <a href="faq/faq15.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS (see the manpage for
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cvs.1">
cvs(1)</a> if
you aren't familiar with CVS) checkout of our ports.  As with our complete
source tree, our ports tree is available via anoncvs.  So, in
order to keep current with it, you must make the <i>ports/</i> tree
available on a read-write medium and update the tree with a command
like:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
# <strong>cd [portsdir]/; cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_4_1</strong>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the local directory and server name here
with the location of your ports collection and a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages through FTP. Updated
packages for the 4.1 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list ports@openbsd.org is a good
place to know.
