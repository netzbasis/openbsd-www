Software Design


If a design focuses on only one issue, ie. "random data quality", the
result is a wimpy interface like /dev/random, which completely ignores
the other issues applications run into.

I NEED TO GET RANDOM DATA IN THREADS

I MAY BE IN CHROOT BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE

I MAY BE OUT OF FILE DESCRIPTORS BUT I DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE

I AM DEEP IN A LIBRARY

I AM THE DNS RESOLVER IN LIBC - OPENING A DEVICE IS
RIDICULOUS
