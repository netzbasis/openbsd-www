Slicing in userland: Interactions with malloc and DNS


In OpenBSD userland, the primary perturber of the stream is the
malloc(3) subsystem

'otto-malloc', this is no longer pkh malloc

malloc() and free() call arc4random very often to make decisions
about behaviour for padding, recycling, and page layout.

This cuts the libc random stream up in (recursively) perturbed fashion.

DNS and ld.so also take slices of random data
