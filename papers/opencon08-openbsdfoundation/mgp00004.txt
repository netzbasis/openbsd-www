How is the OpenBSD Foundation organized?

Cannadian Federally Incorporated Non-Profit
goal is to support all OpenBSD related projects
discussions started at c2k6
organization complete in July 2007
first donation July 31, 2007

Not a charity
so no tax receipts

Charity status means more accounting (CDN$50K/yr)

Currently three member board of directors

Non-profit means we must spend all money in the same year
