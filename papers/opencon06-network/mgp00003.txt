Fundament - routing protocols

legacy stuff - routed, mrouted, route6d
scary old code
no privilege separation

bgpd
3 years in tree - since OpenBSD 3.5
started because of the lack of a good BGP implementation
privilege separation (three process model, imsg framework)
non-cryptic configuration syntax
ospfd
2 years in tree - since OpenBSD 3.7
again three process model and imsg framework but uses libevent to schedule timeouts instead of a huge poll loop
started because the existing OSPF implementations were even worse than the BGP ones
