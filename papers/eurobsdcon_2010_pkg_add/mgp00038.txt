Tracker and UpdateSets

pkg_add creates a list of UpdateSets
some module is responsible for filling the blanks
the engine checks that an UpdateSet is complete
if it's not, the engine merges the UpdateSet with what's needed.

Tracker is responsible for all UpdateSets
The replacement engine is responsible for merging stuff
The dependency engine cooperates with the Tracker to process UpdateSets in the right order.
