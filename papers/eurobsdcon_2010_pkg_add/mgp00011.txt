BSD is dying

and SmallTalk is dead.
(Ask PHK, everyone's doing Lisp^WXML)
But you can still write SmallTalk in perl
open classes can be extended later
hashes are nice for adding to data structure later
modules can use the same hash, not knowing about each other
not many collisions

Same optimization techniques
Same drawbacks
Same benefits
