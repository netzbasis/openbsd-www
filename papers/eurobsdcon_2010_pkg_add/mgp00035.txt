Where do we go from there (Once more with feeling)

Plan to do better updates.
incremental stuff, so we update as we find them
actually use version numbers.

Details again
a lot of special cases showed up
most of them were difficult to predict

Good plan
impossible to design for everything from scratch
get it 99% of the way working, then solve the 1%.
we can't predict the future
perl is good: fluidity
