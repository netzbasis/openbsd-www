Provable semantics

Check dependencies still match
Verify the file system will fit (vstat)
Extract all files in temporary locations
Do various other things

The temporary location is as close as possible to the final one (same
directory usually), so if we can write the file, we can move it.

Only case where it fails is catastrophic failure (panic!!!)...
or bugs in pkg_add (shit happens)
