Smart API: benefits

All package tools use the same interface to packing-lists
all the information is exposed. 
Tools can grab whatever they want.
Full semantic information
everything relevant to a file/other object is there and can be used.
During a package addition, there's a single instance of pkg_add.
doesn't have to rescan /var/db/pkg.
just needs to keep its internal information synchronized.
The same information can be used by validation checkers.
same API, exact same semantic info as pkg_add
