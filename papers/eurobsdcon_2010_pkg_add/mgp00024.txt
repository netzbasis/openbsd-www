Solving the library problem, packages

Package dependencies: do libraries independently.
A package that wants a given library has a @wantlib in its packing-list.
This @wantlib is inserted very late
and dependent on the current system.

Packages register their libraries: those files are tagged with @lib.

A library will be found 
if there's a @lib that matches a @wantlib somewhere
in the @depend tree during installation 
or in the base system
