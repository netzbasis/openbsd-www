The future

Currently pkg_add is fastest using scp: it uses the rsync trick.

http 1.1 would make things faster.
It supports byte-range
so we can "guess" at what we need from a packing-list, and bring a package in slowly.
pkgin frontend
We don't need pkgin. Our pkg_add does everything pkgin does.
But the pkgin UI is nice. It's just a question of writing it.
more ldconfig sugar
write a packing-list interface to common operations, 
stuff like @update-desktop-database doesn't run 20 times during a gnome update.
