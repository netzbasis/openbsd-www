The most controversial decision: Perl

Why not
A lot of people don't like perl for irrational reasons
Write-only code (but see IOCCC)
It could be slow
Long start-up time

But
I like it
Need a RAD platform, let's take one I know
Very modular. Nice namespace system
Perl is part of the base system in OpenBSD
