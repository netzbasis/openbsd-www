Looking back (cont.)

One mistake I did not make was try to solve it at once
pkg_add -u is a practical tool
initial design goals were quickly met

But you can't predict the future
ran into unexpected problems
ran into inefficiencies
have very hard-to-please users...

OpenBSD is an hostile environment, and that's GOOD for quality.
