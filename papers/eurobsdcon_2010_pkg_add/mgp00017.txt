pkg_add -u, up in the sky

Impossible design goal
type pkg_add -u and have it update everything

OpenBSD: realistic goals
Don't try to do sudoku in pkg_add (any debianists ?)

Need for stepping stones
how do I update one single package ?
how will that break if I update more than one ?
how do I discover what I need to update ?
