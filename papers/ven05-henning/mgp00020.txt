found on http://hasso.linux.ee/linux/openbgpd.php:
What is it?
It's quick Openbgpd 3.6 (http://www.openbsd.org) "port" for Linux. It isn't able to communicate with Linux kernel, doesn't have TCP MD5 functionality and IPv6 doesn't work. It compiles for me in Debian Sid and I'm able to use it as route server. That's all. It's full of hacks and just commented out code.

Why?
I just needed bgpd daemon to gather a lot of as path info from it for analysis software.
