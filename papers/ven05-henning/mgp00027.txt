congestion indicator in stack and pf


older, but not well known
perhaps because it just works :)

hacked with bob in edmonton in april 2004

had a rather stupid (but massive) synflood attack
bandwidth: boring, few MBit/s
packet rates: medium
since every single SYN caused a full ruleset traversal, and our ruleset is big, firewall ran out of CPU
could not even log in via cereal console to fix things
unplug network, add a "block in quick proto tcp to $target not port 80" early, everything fine again
