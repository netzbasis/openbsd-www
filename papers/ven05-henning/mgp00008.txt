PF: Interface abstraction


solution: an extra layer of indirection, pfi_kif
interface name
pointer to struct ifnet
NULL if the interface isn't there
hooks in the stack: when a new interface shows up, attach the pf struct with the same name to it, or create a new one

supporting groups is now easy - add a pointer to the group
both pointers to interface and group NULL: detached
pointer to interface or group there determines wether it is a group or an interface
one of 'em must be NULL :)
