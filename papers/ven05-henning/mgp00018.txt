Log message:
make log_in6addr actually work correctly - it is astounding how ugly things
are in the v6 world. the lower 16 bits of the scope ID are embedded in
byte 3 and 4 of the address for link-local addresses... sometimes, at least
these bytes have to be 0 by definition, so we need to fiddle the scope ID
out and reset those bytes to 0. embedding the scopeID like that is the most
disgusting hack I have seen in a while.
