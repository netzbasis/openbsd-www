route labels


bgpd can attach labels to routes

done using the filter language
    allow from $neighbor AS 6762 set rtlabel TELEKOM_ITALIA

labels are stored in the kernel routing table
well, not directly, to save memory, but who cares for implimentation details anyway
  <brahe@skywalker>  $ route -n get 10.0.0.1
     route to: 10.0.0.1
  destination: 10.0.0.1
      gateway: 127.0.0.1
    interface: lo0
   if address: 127.0.0.1
        flags: <UP,GATEWAY,HOST,DONE,STATIC>
        label: foo
    sockaddrs: <DST,GATEWAY,IFP,IFA,LABEL>
