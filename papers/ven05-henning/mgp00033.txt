crazy ideas for future releases


There are ideas for a fast path through the network stack, for forwarded connections with an already set up state

make other parts of the stack use state as well

can carry pointers in mbuf tags (or even in the mbuf header?) around, instead of lookups all the time

prime candidates are routing and ipsec
but it is everything but trivial
