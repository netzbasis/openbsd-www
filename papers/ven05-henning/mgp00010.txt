Interface groups


adding support to "pass|block on group" was trivial - just refers to our abstraction struct anyway

static expansion, as in "pass in to group", is entirely in pfctl
pfctl just gets a list of a group's member interfaces, handles each one like it always does, and then merges the results into one big list

dynamic expansion, as in, "pass in to (group)", is way harder
