crazy ideas for future releases


once this is there, it should be reasonable to offload the fast path to specialized hardware
like, two GE or 10GE interfaces, a FPGA or network processor or similar and some RAM on a PCIe card

ruleset evaluation, route lookup etc go to the Host CPU, established connections are handled on the card

in loose contact with a vendor
GE at wire speed is very realistic
10GE at wire speed? We don't know, but it doesn't seem to be completely impossible
