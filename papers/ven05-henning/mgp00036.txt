crazy ideas for future releases


a rough design with many detail issues thought through is there
ryan & I were on some longer ferry rides earlier this year :)

the real problem is finding time, passion and escape from real life to do it
I expect this to be at least 3 months of dedicated, full-time work
even then: probably 12 to 18 months until it is really ready
