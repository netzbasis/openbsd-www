OpenBSD Implementation
The TIME_WAIT problem

Detailed analysis from Michael Silbersack
"Improving TCP/IP Security Through Randmization Without Sacrificing Interoperability"

before the TIME_WAIT limit has expired
Different OSs deal with this differently
Some OSs (Windows XP, FreeBSD) will stall the connection
