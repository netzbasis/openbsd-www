TCP Sequence Numbers and Timestamps

Proposed solution (diff in testing)
RFC1948-style, using TEA or XTEA as the hash
Top two bits of sequence number space are a counter incremented But this will wrap...
Solution is to lean on PAWS
Top two bits of timestamp are also incremented 
Guarantees that when the sequence number wraps, the timestamp will be increased
