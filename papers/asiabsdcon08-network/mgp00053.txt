Stuff to do

Route validation
is outgoing interface up and running?
needed for static multipath routing
sucks to lose half the traffic when one links drops

MPLS and L2TP
both are often used in VRF scenarios
some code for MPLS is floating around

Support multiple RIBs in bgpd and perhaps ospfd
virtual router
makes only sense together with MPLS
