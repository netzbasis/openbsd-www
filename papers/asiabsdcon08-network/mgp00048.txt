additional routing preference metric is added

every routing source has a defined type

    /* Routing priorities used by the different routing protocols */
    #define RTP_CONNECTED   4       /* directly connected routes */
    #define RTP_STATIC      8       /* static routes */
    #define RTP_OSPF        16      /* ospf routes */
    #define RTP_ISIS        17      /* IS-IS routes */
    #define RTP_RIP         18      /* RIP routes */
    #define RTP_BGP         32      /* BGP routes */
    #define RTP_DEFAULT     48      /* routes that have nothing set */
    #define RTP_MAX         64      /* maximum priority */
