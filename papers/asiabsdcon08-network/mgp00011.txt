mbuf tags - pf(4) hack

pf(4) was massive user of mbuf tags

Every packet got an mbuf tag if pf(4) enabled

Instead pf meta data was moved directly into packet header
pkt header grew a bit
no malloc(9) overhead
remaining data still big enough for small packets

Doubled performance of pf(4) on a soekris box!
