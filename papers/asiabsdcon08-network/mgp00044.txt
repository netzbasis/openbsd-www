Routing Domains

ensure that packets are unable to leave a domain
ICMP, IGMP and even TCP create responses

interface needed to pass traffic between domains
tuned loopback interface

userland needs to be able to bind sockets in specific domain
setsockopt()
per process and inherit on fork()

many things still a bit unclear
pf extension necessary?
interaction with multiple routing tables?
performance impact?
