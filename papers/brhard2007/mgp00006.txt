The hardware: cpu, chipset, boot


All information easily gotten from machine vendors

CPU                     100%
Chipset               95%
boot process      95%

Notes:
Apple & Sun refuse to release chipset docs
Many i386 BIOS bugs, weaknesses & undocumented behaviours
Apple's bootrom is full of bugs

We run better on the VAX than on Sun and Apple machines...
because the VAX is fully documented... a very odd situation
