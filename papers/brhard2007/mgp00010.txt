The hardware: 802.11 wireless networking


Closed US vs Open Taiwan

802.11 wireless   20% documented            95% working

Damien Bergamini is becoming the Bill Paul of wireless -- with claudio,
jsg, mglocker and some other new assistants   (reyk is slacking)

Notes:
Taiwanese/Chinese/European vendors release documentation
All US vendors refuse to release documentation
WARNING:  US vendors are buying foreign vendors!
US chips lead the technology curve... but lose in price
Result is more Asian "open" chips in final product

Good news: Reverse engineering and other approaches have gotten
OpenBSD to 90% support!
