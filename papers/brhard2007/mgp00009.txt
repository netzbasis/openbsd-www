The hardware: ethernet


Only a few recalcitrant vendors remain closed.

ethernet             95% documented           99% working

Open documentation largely due to the effort of one man: Bill Paul

Industry is so competitive that vendors often supply
documentation before chips are available!

Notes:
Broadcom does not release documentation (but helps fix drivers)
Marvell is being dragged open kicking and screaming
Sun/Apple "gem" and Sun "cassini" are not documented
Intel only recently opened up their em/fxp documentation
Good news: At the moment, most 10 Gigabit chipsets are open

Everything else is open!
