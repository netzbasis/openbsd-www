Who in Linux is doing this?


The main problem is many mainline Linux developers act as
if this situation is not gravely dangerous

A choice is being made:

USERBASE is more important than FREEDOM TO TINKER
(Lack of moral fiber / "Falta de envergadura moral")

Without documentation, driver source code is less maintainable

So why not fight for documentation first, and the rest of the
freedoms will take care of themselves?
