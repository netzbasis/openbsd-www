The OEM problem


Chip vendor decisions are entirely disconnected from customers!

chip vendor decisions only depend on VOLUME
chip volume absorbs engineering & business costs
lowers product cost, making it more attractive to the OEM
-> OEM chooses their chip

OEM decisions are entirely disconnected from customers!

decisions only depend on potential price markup
cost reduction decisions normally care about the factory chosen
packaging lies increase sales (500megabit/second 802.11!)
Next week, new chips

Documentation or open source support do not even enter the picture
for the big players -- entirely resistant against consumer action
