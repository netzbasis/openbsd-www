Greylisting Implementations

First one by Evan Harris, a Sendmail Milter, using mysql for a db to store the greylist tuples. Relatively heavyweight due to mysql usage mostly. 

Implementations now exist for most major MTA's. (Postfix's recently had a remotely exploitable hole, beware!)

Spamd has done greylisting since OpenBSD 3.5
