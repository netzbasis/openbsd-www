Initial Stuttering

Recall the large number of connections to a blacklist which disconnect
in a few seconds

After OpenBSD 3.7, spamd will no longer by default talk full speed to greylisted connections. 

Rather, it stutters for the first 10 seconds, and then talks full speed

This means all these dense irritating idiots go away and bother someone else
