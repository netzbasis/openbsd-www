Interpreting the disconnection times

A long tail has beeen removed from this graph, max connection time was over an hour. Sample size, about 110000 blacklisted connections over 36 hours

Lots of them disconnect at around 400 seconds (this is how long it takes to go through the entire dialogue at 1 byte per second)

Some disconnect at 60 seconds - a significant amount of spammers time out after 0 seconds

Another blip at 30 seconds

Lots of them disconnect after a few seconds - once they notice they're being tarpitted. This did not happen as much for the first year or so. We'll come back to this later, and make good use of it.
