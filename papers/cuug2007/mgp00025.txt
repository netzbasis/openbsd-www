testing forwarding performance...


fortunately, we can throttle the cpu :)

at 72 MHz, it is about the speed of the soekris

222 MHz about perfect, ~130 Mbit/s, cpu maxed, but not so overloaded that all time is spent shuffling packets into the then overflowing ipintrq

testing gets harder. single tcp stream doesn't cut it. udp in iperf broken.
