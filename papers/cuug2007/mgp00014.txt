pf used to use mbuf tags for that.
mbuf tags can contain arbitary information, attached to the mbuf, in chains so you can have multiple
first used by ipsec

in the old days, pf used up to eight distinct tags

about a year ago, I folded that into one that has all info in it
that already helps performance when you use that stuff, but I didn't measure back then
