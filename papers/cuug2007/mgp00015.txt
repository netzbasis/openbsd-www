making pf faster


mbuf tags used malloc'd memory

that turned out to be a major performance hit

so stop using mbuf tags, and just stuff what we need into the mbuf header directly.
grows the mbuf pkthdr slightly, but we have room there
no mallocs!

little sucky soekris box was capable of 29 MBit/s, with that change, 58.
just love 100% increases
