64 bit and jit

JIT compilers assume their addresses will fall within 4 GB

FAIL: 64-bit never offered a guarantee like that.
more FAIL: Linux fixed things the wrong way:

void *
mmap(void *start, size_t length, int prot, int flags,
     int fd, off_t offset);

flag MAP_32BIT:
make sure the pointer is a 32-bit pointer (high 32 bits are zero)

Unfortunately, we'll do something similar,
because we don't want our porters to die.
