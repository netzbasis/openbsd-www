64 bit and jit

Allocating in advance...
means writing your own allocator
       (because I need to)
means writing a really fast allocator
       (because I can)
and forgetting about security
       (look ma, no hands!)

Our allocators are designed to protect against attacks,
people writing their own malloc often forget security.

FAIL: most common attack is to spray the JIT

Simple buffer overflow attack works again.
