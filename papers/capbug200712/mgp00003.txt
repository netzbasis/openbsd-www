MULTI_PACKAGES

MULTI_PACKAGES allows you to split a port into multiple subpackages with only one build (with one set of build options).

A common use for this is to create -server and -client packages (which will be demonstrated with the Iodine port).

Iodine lends itself perfectly for demonstrating MULTI_PACKAGES because
it is so small.
