Perl Ports

Perl ports have become very easy to create with the perl and cpan modules. This is the Makefile for p5-List-Cycle:

 # $OpenBSD$  

COMMENT=        objects for cycling through a list of values

DISTNAME=       List-Cycle-0.04
CATEGORIES=     devel

MAINTAINER=     Michael Erdely <merdely@openbsd.org>

 # Perl
PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM=   Yes
PERMIT_PACKAGE_FTP=     Yes
PERMIT_DISTFILES_CDROM= Yes
PERMIT_DISTFILES_FTP=   Yes

MODULES=        cpan
MAKE_ENV=       TEST_POD=1
