MULTI_PACKAGES - Building

The build process is basically the same.
make build
make fake
make plist
make package

make plist does its best to honor how you have separated the compoents for each sub-package, but sometimes these files have to be manually tweaked so the right components go in the right files.

make package will leave you with iodine-client-0.4.0.tgz and 
iodine-server-0.4.0.tgz
