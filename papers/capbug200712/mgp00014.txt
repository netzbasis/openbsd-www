MODULE=

Ports that have common settings amongst many ports of their type can have a special MODULE= directive in the port's Makefile.

For example, gnome ports have the same dependencies and other settings. For consistency, gnome ports include "MODULES= x11/gnome" to include all of the components of /usr/ports/x11/gnome/gnome.port.mk.

Other MODULES include (but not limited to):
textproc/gettext, lang/python and cpan
