Whitelist path feature


pledge() has a 2nd parameter

const char *whitepaths[]

If non-NULL, points at array of pathnames that the program can "see"
All other filesystem objects disappear (ENOENT)

Except directories partway along a whitepath
(these show up as uid 0, gid 0, mode d--x--x--x)

This feature is still being developed.

Not ready to talk about what will use this yet :-)
