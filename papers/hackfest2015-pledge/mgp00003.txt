About me


I found my first security holes in 1987

Created a team to audit all OpenBSD
around 1996

Auditing has serious limits..

... too much complexity to keep in mind


So.. started a team to design & integrate
a variety of MITIGATIONS


Loudmouth Linus called us names; stopped
his team from integrating many mitigations
into his system

See recent article in Washington Post.
