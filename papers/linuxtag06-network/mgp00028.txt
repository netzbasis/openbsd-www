OpenBGPD redundancy - IBGP

Using multiple BGP routers is not so trivial
"depend on" config statement and carp(4) is not the solution
on fail-over all sessions will be reset

Terminate uplinks on different routers
router now have different views
routing information needs to be consolidated

Solution: IBGP full mesh
Interior BGP sessions
