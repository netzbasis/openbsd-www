OpenOSPFD and carp(4)

OpenOSPFD will honour the state of the carp(4) interface
Only the router that is carp master will announce the network

OpenOSPFD is not (yet) able to preempt the carp(4) interface
Workaround: add a direct connection between the two routers

It is not possible to use "redistribute connected" with carp(4)
Instead use "interface carp0"
