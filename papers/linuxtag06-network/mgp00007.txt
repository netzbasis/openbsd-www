OpenBGPD - Design Prerequisites


Security. Code careful, use bounded buffer operations, and account for own failure by using privilege seperation.

Don't lose sessions. There should be a fairly independent session engine.

Performance and memory efficiency, of course.

Well designed config and filter language.
