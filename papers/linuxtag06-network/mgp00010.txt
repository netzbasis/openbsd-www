Existing Implementations
zerba/quagga: OSPF implementation is full of "bugs"
xorp: as the rest of xorp it is far from production ready
Many comercial implementation of various quality

Neither zebra/quagga nor xorp like to run together with OpenBGPD
OpenBGPD and OpenOSPFD are tightly intergrated into OpenBSD
Kernel and routing daemons work together
Possible to change kernel to solve complex issues
