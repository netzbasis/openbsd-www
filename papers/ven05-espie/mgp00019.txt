the other BSDs (cont.)

Writing stuff on top of the existing tools is stupid,
because the existing tools are dumb.

So the new tools have to rebuild information that has
been forgotten.

It takes time
It's sometimes impossible to rebuild the information
Lots of ways to have errors
Everything is complicated: you need to redo the same stuff all the time.
