Vendor reasons and excuses: the bullshit


"Intellectual Property reasons"
Patents? Patents don't matter
patents are open documents
or they are misusing someone else's patents?
Copyrights?  no harm from using their documentation
Trademark law? does not matter
Trade secret?  NDA only apply to person with the docs
Translation:  vendor is lying

"Business reasons" / "Our secrets"
Counterpoint:  The Taiwanese vendors are doing great
business giving us their secrets.

"Disclosure of bugs" / "Crappy engineering"
No vendor has ever given us this reason, but over time
we have come to realize this is the #1 reason
EVERY CHIP we rev-eng'd has turned out to be badly engineered
