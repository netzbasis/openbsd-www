Users defending vendors


If you read various forums you will find many users saying

"Vendors cannot release docs because [one of 20 reasons]"

vendor giving me one of those 20 reasons!

Why do users feel the need to defend vendor behaviours?

Is there a community of "vendor apologists"... or

... are employees of the chip companies trying to fuzz the issue?

... or simply American nature to not criticize the powerful?

... or ...
