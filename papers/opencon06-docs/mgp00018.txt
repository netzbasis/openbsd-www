How about vendor drivers?


Completely UNACCEPTABLE as binaries.
No trust of vendor binaries running in our kernel
No way to fix when it breaks (... and it will break)

Only marginally acceptable as source code
Very difficult to fix when it breaks (... and it will break)

This is not about what the users need, but what we
as developers need (to give the users what they need)

Chip makers end-of-life their products all the time
If we cannot maintain a driver after the vendor stops caring, then
we -- users and developers -- have a broken hardware on our hands.

Vendor drivers rob you of controlling your own destiny
