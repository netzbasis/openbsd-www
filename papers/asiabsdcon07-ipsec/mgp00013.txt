Why is IPsec so hard to use ?

At the protocol spec level, IPsec and ISAKMP/Oakley leave a lot to be desired.
The specification of these protocols is far from understandable.

Overly and uselessly complex
Designed by committee
Requires a thorough understanding of the terminology
And yet.. the terminology is vague and contradictory

These factors have led to many many low-quality pieces of software.
