What is IPsec ?

IPsec does not concern itself with key management at all.

Doing these tasks manually is difficult and error prone.

Several different protocols for this process have been developed.

ISAKMP/Oakley
Photuris
Skeme
JFK (Just fast keying)

Of these ISAKMP is the only one that was ever widely implemented
and put into widescale production.
