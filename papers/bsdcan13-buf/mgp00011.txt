How I learned to love Softdep. 

Softdep slides down the razor's edge of what you can get away with in the midlayer.

1) Consider solution to waiting for resources (phys, kva) in kernel 
2) Convince yourself you are very clever. 
3) Try test implementation in kernel. 
4) Run massively parallel softdep directory creation/deletion test. 
5) Blue moment (ddb> and foul language).
6) Read more code.
7) You're not smarter than Kirk you dumbass.
8) Goto 1) - repeat until enlightenment achieved. 

If you haven't broken softdep, you haven't broken the midlayer.
If you haven't broken softdep, and fixed it, you're not a midlayer hacker.
