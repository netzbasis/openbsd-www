The Original Buffer Cache

Small area, allocated at boot time - 10% of physmem - later parameterized. 

Simple fixed size page cache that never changed.

Always mapped in the kernel address space.

All I/O to disk layer from vfs layer goes through it. 

Fixed size related to other system parameters (vnodes, etc.)
