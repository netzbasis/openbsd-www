Vnodes

If you have an open file - the kernel has a vnode. 

vnode space originally small and fixed.

Changed to allow more vnodes - can grow with cache size.
Allowed to increase - but never decrease. vnodes are still recycled as limits are hit. 
However this led to issues in the name cache - and some other odd things.
