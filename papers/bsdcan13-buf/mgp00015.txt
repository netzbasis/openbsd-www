A fascinating test...

1) Allocate a pile of memory and touch every page. 
2) Fork a couple hundred child processes.
3) Each child makes a unique directory and chdir's to it. 
4) Each child Dumps Core.

It's not torture if you do it to yourself for fun. 
(You might be considered a bit of a perv if you do it in a softdep filesystem)



Such testing finds considerable memory, midlayer, and scheduler issues.
