MDOC(7)                    OpenBSD Reference Manual                    MDOC(7)

NAME
     mdoc - mdoc language reference

DESCRIPTION
     The mdoc language is used to format BSD UNIX manuals.  This reference
     document describes its syntax, structure, and usage.  The reference
     implementation is mandoc(1); the COMPATIBILITY section describes
     compatibility with other troff -mdoc implementations.
</PRE>

<H3>Make documentation
<A HREF="http://xkcd.com/912/">easily accessible</A>:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Have it at as few places as possible,
and as much as possible at one single place.
<LI>In OpenBSD, almost all documentation is manuals,
and the little that doesn't fit there is all in the FAQ.
</UL>
<H3>Thus, manuals are very important in OpenBSD.</H3>

<H1>Don't be lazy.</H1>
<H2>What went wrong while getting the tree to build?</H2>
<UL>
<LI>We should have started several months earlier.
<LI>At first, mandoc reported way too many fatal errors.
<LI>Too few mandoc bugs were fixed in this phase.
<LI>Too many workarounds committed to manuals instead.
</UL>

<H3>Lessons learnt:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>From the start, avoid throwing fatal errors when possible.
<LI>By all means, report errors, but try hard to keep going.
<LI>Try real-world usage as early as possible and use the feedback.
<LI>Move quickly into production, don't delay for polishing.
<LI>Code will only really mature when used.

<H1>The future is already past.</H1>
<H2>When i proposed this talk, groff-1.20 was a plan.</H2>
<H3>We now provide a groff-1.21 port.</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Advantage of the move to ports even for groff lovers:
<LI>It is much easier to update ports than base.
<LI>And the GPL v3 doesn't hurt so much in the ports tree.
<LI>NetBSD and FreeBSD are stuck with groff-1.19.2 which was released in 2005.
</UL>
<H3>According to the ChangeLog, groff-1.21 has:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Unicode, wide characters, Japanese localization.
<LI>XHTML output (crappy, of course, but at least something).
<LI>Many tbl(1) improvements, including MathML output.
