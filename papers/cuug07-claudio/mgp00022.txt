Route validation

makes it possible to unplug a cable but host on that LAN are still reachable
via a different interface and cable
configuring the same network twice still causes troubles
ifa_ifwith*() functions need some additional tweaks

next step would be to check for valid nexthops
incredible complicated
error prone
I don't like it
checking for link layer entries is russian roulette
