Priv-seperated + tame is even more interesting


If a program has already been split into seperate processes
with different roles, and different needs

For instance, OpenNTPD:

ntp engine: "stdio inet dns proc"
parent:     "stdio unix proc ioctl"

Isolation need not be perfect.  Compare to non-OpenBSD NTP.
