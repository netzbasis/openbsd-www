rtable vs rdomain


rtable
alternate routing table, usable with the same interfaces
ip addresses cannot overlap
multiple rtables can belong to a single rdomain

rdomain
completely independent routing table instance
want to assign 10.0.0.1/8 a dozen times?
interfaces can be assigned to only one at a time
how we 'know' which one incoming packets should use
rdomains always contain at least one rtable

for now, ipv4 only
ipv6 support is on the way
90% of the way there, just need the other 90%
