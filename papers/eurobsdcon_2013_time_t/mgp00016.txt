Standard Power / Utility / Resource management networks


I live in Alberta

Oil/gas extraction management is *extremely network intensive*

How much of their network equipment is tested for 2038 compliance?

How much of it will still be around?

How much of it could create a public safety risk?

I worry about these issues.
