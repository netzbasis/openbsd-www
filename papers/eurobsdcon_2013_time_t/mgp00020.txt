Possible Solutions?


a) unsigned 32-bit time_t is unworkable
b) adding new APIs does not encourage repair of old code
c) time64_t is unworkable (also does not fix old code)
d) non-integer types bring new problems

e-y) unknown solutions (do it -- then give a talk!)

z) Only one solution works.  64-bit / "long long" time_t

Must fix well before 2038: deploy solution into
upgrade/replacement cycle

*ALL* systems must transition to 64-bit time sooner rather than later
