Lay... Incubate... Hatch... Walk.... Eat.


Software is not a chicken... we need more than heat.

OpenBSD development style:
  Look at a problem space.
  Look to see what smart or idiotic ideas other people have had.
  Think hard.  Think harder.
  We are about to change the entire world.  THINK REAL HARD.

  Pick the solution.

  Clean up the simple mistakes first.
  Work on the hard ones.  When it is right....

  Break the APIs, the ABIs, and cross over to a new universe.

  Clean up the ports tree.
