Transitions can be hard


Some changes require a tougher approach:

master.passwd:

deraadt:*:1000:1000:staff:0:0:Theo de Raadt:/home/deraadt:/bin/ksh
                                            ^^^

"change time" and "expire time" fields are stored as time_t in the
pwd.db and spwd.db databases

Hacking around this problem would be more painful in the long term,
though.

We force our users to do binary upgrades.
