Old war: Product Management versus Engineering

       ''Accordingly, West called Wallach to his office in the spring of
    1978 and asked him to draw up the architecture for a 32-bit Eclipse.

       Steve Wallach glared at West.  Wallach got to his feet and,
    coining a phrase, said: "F**k that!  I'm not puttin' a bag on
    the side of the Eclipse."  Then he stomped out of West's office.''
