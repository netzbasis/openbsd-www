Specific Examples (malloc)


Started with junk-filling for free()
then added in-kernel mmap() randomization
then < page size randomization
then cached-object randomization
then multiple free detection
then unique write-protected malloc(0)

        do {
                theo or miod suggests an idea
                otto makes more changes 
                tedu suggests a speedup
                otto speeds it up
        } while (!bored(otto));

Some parts optional, some parts mandatory.

Many developers run with the optional parts enabled.
