Userland audit


Parts of userland that required lots of changes:

  amd ar arp at authpf bgpctl bgpd calendar compat_linux cpio cron
  csh cvs dd dhclient dhcpd dump dvmrpctl file find fsck_ext2fs
  fsck_ffs fsdb fsdb fsirand ifconfig isakmpd kdump ksh ld ld.so
  libevent make mtree ndp netinet6 netstat newfs_ext2fs ospfctl pfctl
  ping ping6 pppd/chat procfs pstat quotas ranlib rarpd rbootd rcs
  rdistd relayctl relayd restore ripctl rtadvd rtsold rup rusers rwho
  scan_ffs scp smtpd ssh sysctl syslogd talkd tar time tmux top user
  vacation vmt write yppoll ...

Many userland changes were as simple as "%lld" (long long)t

But a few required substantial head scratching.
