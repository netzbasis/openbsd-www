POSIX systems have taken over the embedded world


32-bit QNX and embedded Linux in critical infrastructure
switches/routers

Pipeline monitoring, electrical grid, etc

Many 32-bit devices still being installed today

Less, year by year, but when does it stop?



If anything, one lesson is simple:

    Older (known reliable, less power hungry, cheaper) cpu platforms
    will be placed into critical roles, with very very long lifecycles
