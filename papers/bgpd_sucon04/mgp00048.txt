bgpd - evil future plans


Give pf access to some information from bgpd

allow for freetext labels attached to a route
32 bytes we can use to attach arbitary information
implemented in route(8) and the kernel routing table
pf can't filter based on the label yet, and bgpd can't set it - will be there soonish...

This is really evil:
        pass in proto tcp keep state route-label swisscom queue reallyslow
