bgpd - tcp md5 signatures


Very old code for tcp md5 signatures existed, but didn't work. We used it as starting point.

We implemented tcp md5 signatures as Security Association within the IPsec framework

bgpd got a pfkey interface to interact with the IPsec framework

tcp md5sig is extremly easy to configure, works with ciscos and junipers, too: USE IT!
