OpenBSD Implementation
IPID Randomisation

Constraints
16 bits
Must not repeat too soon to avoid reassembly errors

Similar algorithm to DNS Query Randomisation
Linear Congruential Generator
Seeded from arc4random()
15 bits pseudo-random
Rekeys after 180 seconds or ~12000 id's
Toggle most significant bit to avoid reuse
