OpenBSD Implementation
PF Randomness

Not everyone uses randomness the way they should... so we can put it in for them.

Why in the firewall?
We're already tracking connection state - so it's easy
It's expected that a firewall can be agressive about packet modification
Some of the randomness happens anyways, for functional reasons
source port and ip for NAT
The firewall code already makes packet modifications for other reasons
The firewall provides fine-grained control of randomness injection
