What's this about?


Most of you know, but 12 OpenBSD developers came to
Venice on October 31 to hack on ports and share ideas.  We had a great time and this is a small report on what we did.

Thanks to Fabio and OpenCON people for providing
us with the opportunity to be here, it is really
cool to hack on a small island like this.
