Example of big update


gettext by naddy@
gettext is a GN* library used by thousands of projects and updating things like this is quite a long process.  It was out-of-date by 3.5 years.

completely re-done port from scratch for version 0.14.5
affects 450+ packages that USE gettext, must not break any
test on all major architectures
build the whole ports tree to test if it works (takes 2-3 days on fast i386)
found several broken ports, all fixed now, and update committed (late last night)
