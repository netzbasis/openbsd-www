FETCH_PACKAGES


Very cool FETCH_PACKAGES stuff worked on by Nikolay Sturm
Idea: ports tree and package tools need to interract more
try to build missing binary packages from ports tree (pkg_add vs 'make install')
ports tree checks pkg_add for missing packages (opposite)

So set FETCH_PACKAGES=Yes, and PKG_PATH to package repository.

What happens
if a package is missing during 'make install', pkg_add looks in PKG_PATH (ftp, etc.)
