OpenBSD - a group effort

There is Theo at the top
     BUT OpenBSD is still a group effort

If you hack a lot in a certain area, you become responsible for it

Roughly 90 more or less active developers

Being nice and friendly does not create the best technology
     neither does voting or lots of chit-chat

Discuss ideas and changes with co-developers, in-tree development

commit early, commit often - of course with proper peer review
