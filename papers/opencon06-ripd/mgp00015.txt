"The value used in the sequence number is arbitrary, but two suggestions are the time of the message's creation or a simple message counter"

A sequence number based on a packet counter is REALLY easy to guess
Time is not a secret!

Our implementation:

Hash the secret key and add it to the time of message's creation
key is secret so the number generated is not easily guessable
