Authentication	1/9


Default RIPv2 mode is completely unauthenticated

It is vulnerable to every kind of attack you can imagine
you can inject route
you can reply route
you can DoS a router

It is thought to be run across secure links

You don't want to run RIP without any authentication, right? :)
