Our implementation:

Sequence number generation of ripd allows us to never send zero sequence number packets

ripd remembers the last sequence number sent
if the network is made up only of ripd routers we should allow a user to force ripd to discard packets with seq num = 0 (SHOULD allow us to do so)

One more time dangers come from other implementations we must be compliant with
