Authentication	9/9


RFC 2082 states:
"... permits other algorithms (e.g., Keyed SHA) to be substituted for Keyed MD5 if desired"

We discussed to implement a new authentication algorithm
Better anti-replay algorithm
accept only HIGHER sequence numbers
remove zero sequence number crap
store sequence number in a secure way to reuse them after a reboot or crash
Hash of:
ip header
udp header
rip header
sequence number
secret key
