Traditional Process Address Space - Program w/Shared Libs

Similar to static program
Kernel also mmaps runtime linker (ld.so) and adds auxiliary vector data to bottom of stack
ld.so is executed first which mmaps the rest of the shared libs in the order they were linked
Each invocation of user program has same process layout
Only changing the datasize hard limit will change location of shared libs
