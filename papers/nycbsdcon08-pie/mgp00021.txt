Conclusions

Helps prevent return-to-libc type attacks on main program itself
Most value will come from when static programs are supported
Less effective for forking daemons like apache 1.3 or 2.x using prefork
Will be able to use soon
Works on all gcc3 archs except arm:
i386
amd64
alpha
sparc64
macppc/powerpc
landisk/sh
hppa
sgi/mips64
arm needs a binutils update to fix relocation bugs
