W^X Consequences


Improves security

Makes exploit authoring very difficult.

Improves performance

Some architectures even speed up (TLB handling improvements)
None slowed down

Breaks nothing

Some people ask about JIT compilation systems like Java.
If a program does not use msync() and mprotect() correctly
it will not work on a machine with split I-D caches... so
nothing new here.
