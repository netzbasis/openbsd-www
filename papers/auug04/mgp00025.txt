And of course -- non-accessable memory: Guard pages


Concept:  Put an unmapped page between all allocations
Like "Electric Fencing"

In malloc() ....
malloc.conf 'G' option makes page allocations be guarded

In mmap()

Some application breakage:

This is when we find out how much "Open Source" is garbage
So much software accesses 1 byte beyond the end of an object,
    generating a fault..

As a result, this cannot be enabled by default yet.
