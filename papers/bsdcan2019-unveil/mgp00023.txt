Intermediate "Hidden" unveils - Unveil's dirty secret

unveil has a hidden permission of "INSPECT" - anything you traverse on the way to an unveil becomes "inspectable"

So, if you unveil "/home/beck/Downloads" as above with "rwxc"

In absence of other unveils, four vnodes are remembered for you in the kernel, your

   1. / can be inspected
   2. /home can be inspected 
   3. /home/beck can be inspected
   4. /home/beck/Downloads can be "rwxc"

As of OpenBSD 6.5, unveil no longer allows stat() and access() with inspect, thanks to the work of our intrepid porters. Show robert@ and antoine@ some love.
