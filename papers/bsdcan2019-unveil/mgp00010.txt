If you're not dead, what happens?

Pledge(2) violation is "easy", your program dies. Unveil is segmenting a filesystem. Filesystems have complicated semantics, and you don't actually want the program to die. 

There are nuances around:

- libc used files
- per-program known files
- files provided by argv[] or configuration
- filenames just known by a program
- file names inside $HOME
- the ability to create abstract trees using symbolic links.
- the ability to change working directory and walk up and down.
