Fix the software we depend on that does this! Upstream it!

robert@ and antoine@ are maintaining patches to glib, dconf, and chrome. Their solution is to always try to do the operation first, and to only check path components after a failed attempt. 

glib and chrome:
    - mkdir (just make the directory - walk the path if necessary)
    - patches accepted upstream by glib this week!

dconf:
    -Creates config directory even if you already have it
    -Just open instead.. deal if it fails.

These changes make a significant difference in performance and
security
  -Lessens the chance of a TOC VS TOU mistake.
  -Increases performance (110 less system calls to open a file dialog)
