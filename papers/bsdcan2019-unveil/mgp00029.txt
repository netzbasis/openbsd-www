Future Work

OpenBSD 6.6 :
 -Finish kernel realpath(), remove readlink() exception for path
 components
 -Restrict ../ to not be usable outside of the unveil'ed path
 components

Later:
 -Handle inheritance across exec() - as pledge() exec promises also evolves.
 -Currently preserved across fork(), but not exec()
 -This is still in flux, as proper semantics of pledge and unveil across exec() are being considered.
