Physicist approach

Annotate each core with a "speed factor"
Approximation of processor speed (many cores)
Slower machines should build smaller packages
Again: directed by previous builds
sort packages according to build times
biggest stuff go to the biggest machine, and so on.
simple dynamic problem, that's optimum...
... if everything is known
