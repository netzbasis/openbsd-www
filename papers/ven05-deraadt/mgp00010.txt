W^X - The Mechanism


Depends on MMU Architecture:

sparc sparc64 alpha
amd64 ia64 hppa        per-page X bit
i386                   code segment limit ("line in sand"),
                                                        or PAE NX
powerpc                per-segment X bit (per-page on G5)
arm                    soft TLB management on some
m88k                   Split code & data mmu
vax m68k mips          not possible

OpenBSD currently has W^X on:

sparc sparc64 alpha amd64 hppa i386

Not implemented:

powerpc m88k ia64

We need a few process address space changes to support this...
