i386 and PAE NX (continued)


We would like to use PAE on the i386, but are afraid of the
complexity or performance effects

Would have to support two MMU modes in the same architecture:

OpenBSD/sparc - sun4, sun4c, sun4m: 3 architectures
                               7000 lines for pmap
Typical pmap module is 1300-3000 lines of code

Do not want PAE to be a compile option.

I am trying to convince vendors to make a trivial 32-bit NX 
extension.

i386 W^X is sufficient, but one day we must try using NX
