What was done - preparation


Dale based the zaurus port on OpenBSD/cats, taking code to support the PXA25x CPU and some startup code from
NetBSD


The code taken from NetBSD was modified to support      PXA27x CPUs and common OpenBSD paradigms

Created GENERIC and RAMDISK kernel configurations for the zaurus
