What was done - multi-user/native builds


At this point we were ready to do a full MACHINE=zaurus make build and MACHINE=zaurus make release on cats, to create the distribution tar file sets, a very first snap

Used the RAMDISK kernel and the resulting sets to do     the first normal installation of OpenBSD on the internal hard drive

Started to build native snapshots and to make them available on the project's FTP mirrors
