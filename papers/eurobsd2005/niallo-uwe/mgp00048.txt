Many zaurus drivers are "layered", i.e. split into a generic part and one that encapsulates only the machine-specific details

currently: apm, pxapcic, pxaohci, pxalcd, zaudio

machine-specific parts can be small, sometimes just an "attachment driver", to attach a generic device at a bus for which it was not specifically designed
