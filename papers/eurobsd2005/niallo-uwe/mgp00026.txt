What was done - VM bringup


Our user-friendly GREEN LED illuminated the way through initarm() and sub routines as we boot-strapped the VM system and mapped the physical memory spaces

Apart from the kernel image and free space in RAM, essential register spaces such as the
GPIO controller
interrupt controller
"SCOOP"s
are mapped at fixed virtual addresses

Because we call their drivers before the VM system is fully operational, e.g. to attach the serial driver com(4)
