Evil future plans

Make it possible to determine if all routers are in sync

Make it possible to create a network graph from the LS DB
creates nice coloured network graphs for web pages

Add a way to calculate the rib for any router in the network
The LS DB includes all necessary information
perfect for monitoring systems

After all is done I may perhaps start on OSPFv3 aka IPv6 support
