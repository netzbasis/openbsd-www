Introduction - Routing Algorithms

Link-State Algorithms
every router sends out his link-states
all router keep a database of all link-states
calculates shortest path
Features
good convergence properties
automatic neighbor discovery
Problems
complex because the database needs to be in sync
Examples
IS-IS, OSPF
