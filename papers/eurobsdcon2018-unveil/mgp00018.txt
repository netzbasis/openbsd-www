Arbitrary file access

Unveil isn't useful if the program needs to access arbitrary files throughout its execution.

TZ/TERMCAP/TERM
Can actually specify an artbitrary file - Thanks Unix!
Opponent can use these to force you to open an aribitrary file
Result is you can't effectively unveil without breaking program
It would be nice to defang these, but is hard considering historical program behaviour.

This is on Theo's list of pet things to change in the world now...
