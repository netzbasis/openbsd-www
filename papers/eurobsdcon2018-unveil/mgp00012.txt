Hey Chrome! Set my downloads directory to /home/beck/Downloads!

The kitchen sink libraries Chrome is built with then do:

stat("/");
access("/");
stat("/home");
access("/home");
stat("/home/beck");
access("/home/beck");
stat("/home/beck/Downloads");
access("/home/beck/Downloads");
opendir("/home/beck/Downloads");

Chrome will stat /home and helpfully try to create it if it does not exist. (Chrome as a system provisioning tool anyone?)

Chrome's behaviour really drove home the problem of exposing interesting program behaviour when things fail.
