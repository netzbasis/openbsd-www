Unveil All The Things! (the initial enthusiasm)



As predicted by both myself and Theo, someone promptly wanted to unveil whatever someone gives them on argv[].

Unveil achieves low cost by using kernel resources (vnodes), so it is limited to a reasonable number of vnodes held.
       
       E2BIG if you go over the limit while you are unveil'ing. 

       No! don't unveil argv[]
