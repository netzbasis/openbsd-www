Symbolic Link Farms Can Be^W^WAre  Hell

Enter symbolic links.

(cd /home/beck && ln -s ./Downloads herp)
(cd /home/beck/derp && ln -s ../Downloads herp)
ln -s /home/beck /home/bob
unveil("/home/beck/Downloads", "rwxc")

Now consider:

    Access to Downloads by path /home/bob/Downloads
    Access to Downloads by path /home/beck/herp
    Relative access to Downloads from CWD /home/beck
    Relative access to Downloads from CWD /home/beck/derp

We have to allow reading of non-terminal symbolic links in a path

Apply restrictions to what the symlink points to

We have to remember when we started from an unveiled directory as our CWD
