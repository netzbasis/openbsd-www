Algorithm - version 1

Kernel and uspace have different requirements
Kernel:
some MD allocations are fixed address
rest is allocated anywhere
some allocations require alignment
cannot use whole address space
Userspace:
some allocations are fixed address
some allocations are hint address
some allocations require alignment
can use whole address space
i386 is special
need randomization
need gaps
