Provider situation in Canada (specifically Calgary)


Refuse to install Fiber to homes (asked 10 installers)

Refuse to install T3 to homes

My T1 is considered legacy -- refuse to do new T1 installs

Residential DSL (1Mb out, 6Mb in) -- no BGP peering

Residencial DOCSIS2 (?!?!!) (1.5Mb out, 10Mb in) -- no BGP peering

Business Cable modem (5Mb in, 5Mb out) -- no BGP peering

Wireless options cost per-Mb (heavy QoS, too)

All these links have 1500 MTU, will not increase MTU
