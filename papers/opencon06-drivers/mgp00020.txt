Reverse Engineering (continued)

Analyse bus access
Windows filter driver (ie USB Snoopy)
Hardware Bus analyser
Virtualised OS given access to real hardware
Relatively easy for transaction based buses (ie USB)
DMA buses really need hardware remapping (like Intel pre IA64 silicon SoftSDV)
Dissassemble
Driver for other operating systems
Device firmware
Analyse code
Try to find information from drivers often written under NDA...
Analyse hardware
Read out default register, EEPROM states
Grind the IC, use electron microscope or similiar to determine logic
Test guesses
Virtual hardware driver with vendor driver
Implement in userspace for easy testing?
