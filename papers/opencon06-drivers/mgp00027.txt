Dealing with vendors

A lot of our time is spent dealing with vendors

We write only open drivers, so we don't sign NDAs

Drivers full of magic numbers are not open

It helps to show that they are losing sales

It helps to talk about how helpful competitors are

Errata describing hardware bugs is nearly non existent

Large north american companies are the hardest to deal with

Many are too short sighted to do anything that isn't an immediate sale
