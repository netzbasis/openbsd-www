Kernel Libraries


libkern:
Mostly a subset of the C library for the kernel
A few minor changes like bit field format string, see printf(9)


libsa:
Mostly a subset of C library for stand alone programs (bootloaders)

Dependencies on other parts of the kernel are defined by referencing
autoconfig labels ie "scsi" for SCSI midlayer, "firmload" for
firmware loading code. This makes maintaining kernel configurations
much easier than it otherwise would be.
