What does not work?

USB races that hang the ohci controller upon ejecting certain PC Cards (Huawei Mobile Connect among them)

No support for the status- / diag-port

Novatel Wireless devices need to have magic frames send to their diag port, no docs available, vendor does not reply to e-mails :(

Due to our ubsa(4) driver we only attach the modem port of those devices and also have no clue on howto talk to the second port

Once we know how to talk to the status- / diag-ports, we could have signal strength and alike as a sensor...

None of the 802.11 chips present on a lot of UMTS pc card's are supported (except for very recently, where support for a Marvel chipset, malo(4), was added)
