Future of UMTS

The next generation technologies, based on UMTS, are already being deployed.

HSDPA, High Speed Downlink Packet Access

allows even more bandwith on the downlink, currently around 1.8 Mbit/s (category 12) and soon 3.6 Mbit/s (category 6), after that 7.2Mbit/s

requires newer hardware

HSUPA, High Speed Uplink Packet Access

will enhance the uplink bandwith, up to 5.8Mbit/s

currently being standardized by 3GPP
