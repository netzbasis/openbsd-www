EDGE - Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution

enhances the datarates possible in GSM networks by using a different modulation than GPRS

possible datarates vary between 150 - 200 kBit/s

basically can be seen as a faster way of doing GRPS and was meant as a stepping stone on the way to fully capable UMTS networks.
