What do we use this for?

Roadwarrior setups, it's nice to have instant internet anywhere

Not only mobile use is interesting, UMTS can be a nice fallback if all other lines fail

Providing Internet Access where there is only GSM

At conferences where the wifi sucks

At the bar to show of your zaurus!
