Enhancing your connection

What you can do to enhance your connection:

if reception is not the best, make sure to switch the device into GPRS mode only, otherwise it will try to switch back and forth between UMTS and GPRS

use a UDP based VPN, through which you route all the traffic

this will enhance the rtt

avoids proxy crap done by ISPs

...and of course gives you access to a device usually hidden behind the NAT of the ISP.
