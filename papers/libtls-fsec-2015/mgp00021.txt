Many LibreSSL things done this week here in Varazdin. 


SSLv3 was finally burned to the ground (we don't need no water...)
Cleaned the awful old DTLS 1.1. code, merged with the regular functions, removing much code.
DTLS_badver (nonstandard DTLS) removed. 
Engine got closer to being removed - We removed it from the openssl(1) command.
Extra DSA key checks added to guard against bad behavoir
Bugs in ECDHE key generation fixed that could allow for silent key truncation
SHA-0 got a Viking funeral from libcrypto.
Most of the way to DTLS 1.2 support.

Netcat got TLS support
