Problem:

Traditional OpenSSL API makes this challenging

Does not follow semantics of read() and write()

Can do strange things. Like try to connect to a different daemon when you do a read or write (EGD) or block on a descriptor (/dev/Xrandom) 

LibreSSL doesn't do this. 

So we can attempt to make something compatible with read() and write() semantics
