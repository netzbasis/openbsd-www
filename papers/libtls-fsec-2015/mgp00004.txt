OpenSSL Current is over 1000000 lines, of which  411000 lines is C.

LibreSSL current today is 511000 lines, of which 297000 lines is C.

This includes libtls and other things that have been added to the library. (Brainpool, ChaCha, poly1305, ANSSI FRP256v1, GOST, libtls, dtls 1.2)

Most applications you would care about work fine with LibreSSL.

This is largely thanks to OpenBSD ports developers. (9000+ ports)
