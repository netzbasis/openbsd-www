Integration - Shutdown

Startup is trivial compared to the issues on shutdown
at least I thought so

init(8) kills all userland processes before syncing disks
iscsid(8) gone but filesystem is still mounted
with sym(4) and mpath(4) the kernel just waits

either unmount disk before iscsid(8) is killed by init
or keep iscsid(8) running until disks are synced
