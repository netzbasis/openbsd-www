iscsid(8) - why?

iscsid is not the first iSCSI initiator
FreeBSD has an in-kernel initiator
NetBSD started with a userland initiator using ReFUSE
now has AFAIK also an in-kernel initiator

we think we can do "better"
simpler implementation
more security
privilege dropping, less kernel code

mild form of NIH syndrome?
