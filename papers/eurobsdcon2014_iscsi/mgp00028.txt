quick test showed that it is possible to keep iscsid(8) alive
until file systems are synced by shutdown

Added a process flag to indicate that a process should not
be killed by a broadcast kill (kill -1)

iscsid(8) sets this no broadcast kill flag on startup

could also be used to keep other
processes alive during shutdown
syslogd(8) - keep logging until as late a possible
