malloc() ... UNFORTUNATELY


Unfortunately much software is written to very low standards

The more of these features we enable, the more bugs we run into


malloc.conf 'G' option:
"Guard".  Enable guard pages and chunk randomization.  Each
page size or larger allocation is followed by a guard page that
will cause a segmentation fault upon any access.  Smaller than
page size chunks are returned in a random order.

A few malloc features cannot be enabled by default yet
