W^X and !W: atexit() in libc


Introducing a case of minimum page permission use in libc

void exit(int status)
{
        struct atexit *p;            int n;

        for (p = __atexit; p; p = p->next)
                for (n = p->ind; --n >= 0;)
                        (*p->fns[n])();
        if (__cleanup)
                (*__cleanup)();
        _exit(status);
}

__atexit and __cleanup contain writeable function pointers!


We modified atexit(3) to maintain function pointer storage
which is kept non-writeable
