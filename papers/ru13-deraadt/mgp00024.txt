Stack Protector


Compiler modification which catches most common stack-smashing
problems

Original: http://www.trl.ibm.com/projects/security/ssp/

Compiler instruments generated code for each function:
Prologue stores a random value (canary) on the stack
Function Epilogue aborts if value has changed

Integrated into OpenBSD in December 2002

Industry (mostly Google) now making further enhancements
