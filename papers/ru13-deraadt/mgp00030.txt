Adoption: Most vendors


Microsoft has all significant mitigations fully integrated and enabled!!

Linux has code for all the mitigations.  Most vendors enable them very
sparingly (sshd), and in general support is disabled... :-(

Apple has ASLR (but not the other methods?)

Most Cell-phone platforms use these features, but less protection
benefit (thread-intensive environments)

The upstream software ecosystem (ports) is ready and willing.
