GPS with PPS: tty timestamping


PPS signal has to be wired to a serial ports CTS or DCD line

When the PPS even occurs, the current system time is immediately copied to a buffer by the tty device

nmea(4) copies the timestamp at the next possible occasion

Keep in mind:  It is precise, but OpenBSD is not a real-time operating system
