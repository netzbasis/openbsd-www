State table reorganisation
Some observations

Except for the alternate routing tables (which was needed for other reasons anyways), no major backouts were required.
Some small but scary changes were temporarily disabled when problems were encountered.

Unfortunate side effects:
New model is more challenging to understand and work with.
Fortunate side effects
We get the ability to do nat/rdr on both inbound & outbound
Particularly helpful when you need to rewrite both addresses
Currently disabled in the parser (lots of documentation and possibly a little code needed to handle the routing challenges).
New model makes it easier to implement things we didn't plan for (like NAT64).
