Maintainability & Aesthetic Beauty
Neverending code cleanup

ongoing style(9) cleanup
Still some minor things to be found with static analysers (i.e. clang)

Some small things (noticed at n2k10 in Melbourne):
inconsistent use of "pd" (struct pf_desc)
some type inconsistencies (int,u_int8_t vs. sa_family_t)
data structures cleanup (particularly struct pf_state, pf_rule)

Complicated Internals
Tables code uses the kernel routing table patricia tree code.
pfr_buffer code in general
        	Requires passing arrays of identical objects
pfctl's handling of anchors is a nightmare
