Usability & Maintainability
pf.conf Syntax

Nominally LALR
Initially based on ipf syntax
Organic, mostly unplanned growth as PF gained functionality
Now very challenging to maintain and extend
parse.y has become increasingly confused whether or not it is a line oriented parser

    anchor in on $fxp0 {
        block
        pass in proto udp from any to $webserver port { 80, 443 }
        pass in proto { udp, tcp } from any to $dnsserver port 53
        pass in proto tcp from any to { $webserver $dnsserver } port 22
    }
