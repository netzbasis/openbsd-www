State table reorganisation
Evolution by design

Initial goal: end-to-end connection tracking
PF states, routing, IPsec, tcp/udp all do similar lookups
2 PF state lookups done on a forwarded packet
We can combine these into a single lookup

A number of other improvements were obtained along the way
Single 'pf_test_rules' rather than protocol-specific almost copies
Improved state creation code
Fix handling 'if-bound' states 
Deprecation of 'scrub' rules
Deprecation of separate translation ruleset
'match' rules
