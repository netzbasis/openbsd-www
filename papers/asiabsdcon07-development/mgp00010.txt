Multiple architectures

A.K.A. "Did you test it on sparc64?"

OpenBSD supports 16 hardware platforms covering 12 CPU architectures, and a few more are in development.

All our architectures are built natively.
'make build' is a good stress test
this turns up architecture-specific issues

Developing for multiple hardware platforms will help catch bugs, even if they're not your current target market.

For OpenBSD, porting to a new platform typically reveals a significant number of Machine Independant bugs.
