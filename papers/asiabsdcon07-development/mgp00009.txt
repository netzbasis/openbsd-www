More malloc() behaviour available

Abort (A) - core with malloc failure
Freeguard (F) - Use after free protection
Guard (F) - Guard pages and chunk randomisation
Junk (J) - Fill junk in to allocated area
Pointer Protection (P) - catch sizeof(ptr) errors
Zero (Z) - like (J), but zero the area the user asked for

This is all documented in malloc(3)
