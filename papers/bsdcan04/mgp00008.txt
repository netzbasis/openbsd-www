W^X Transition (3 of 5): Intro to dynamic binaries




An example of how shared
libraries (used to) map

Note the "data" segments which
are supposed to be only RW- but
contain objects which are RWX

And additional danger is that
some objects are writeable when
they do not need to be, ie.
GOT/PLT/dtors
