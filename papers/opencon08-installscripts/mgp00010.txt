Stupid Tricks

Installing a different version
!export VERSION=43

Adding peripherals
!export MTDEVS="$MTDEVS xt9"

Testing new install scripts
just copy over install.sh as install, etc.

Different sets in list
!export THESETS="$THESETS myset.tgz"

Install but don't destroy an existing partition
Don't provide mount point, use, update fstab by hand

Overflow ramdisk storage - big hosts file, (protocols, services?) etc.
stripcom more places when copying files
