OpenBSD Install Script Philosophy

My first two install script commits:
krw@cvs.openbsd.org     2000/02/24 18:39:14
krw@cvs.openbsd.org     2001/04/12 19:29:25

Get fully functional installation in place as quickly as possible and let user configure from there.

No mouse necessary to install!

Why floppy images?
