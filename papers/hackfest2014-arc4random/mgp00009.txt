Software Design


If a design focuses on only one issue, ie. "random data quality", the
result is a wimpy interface like /dev/random, which completely ignores
the other issues applications run into.

I need to get random data in threads...

I may be in chroot but i don't know for sure...

I may be out of file descriptors but i don't know for sure...

I am deep in a library...

I am the DNS resolver in libc - opening a device per packet
is ridiculous
