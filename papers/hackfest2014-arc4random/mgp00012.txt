-fstack-protector influenced arc4random()


End of 2002, the stack protector (SSP) is developed in OpenBSD

In userland, crt0 initialized the cookie before calling main()

In kernel, main() initialized the cookie itself

ld.so support came much later

In 2014, initialization is via the ELF .openbsd.randomdata segment
from execve() or the boot-loader

Now each shared-object (main program, libc, ld.so) has
an independent SSP cookie

This is state of the art... and noone is aware!
