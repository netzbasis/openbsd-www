Slicing in the kernel


Lots of activities slice random data from the (sole) kernel stream:

random pid (fork, thread creation)
ASLR mappings, mmap (including userland malloc / free requests)

packet creation - sequence numbers.

pf NAT and other operations

port allocation

scheduler decisions

and... userland arc4random re-seedings via getentropy(2)

Extraction creates effects similar to entropy insertion
