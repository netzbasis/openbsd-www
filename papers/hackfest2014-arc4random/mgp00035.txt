Userland re-seeding considerations


Same "Something old, something new" principle from the kernel
is used in userland reseeding

libc arc4random() reseeds when

- too much volume of data has moved
- too much time has elapsed
- or when a fork() is detected

Recently, the fork() detection logic underwent substantial
improvements

WARNING: Some systems have old code which handles this wrong!
