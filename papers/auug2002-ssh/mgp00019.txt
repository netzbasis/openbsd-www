SSH Protocol v.2 protocol start - continued


Output from key exchange is two keys:
Server to client
Client to server

The client & server may have different options. e.g.
client may send data encrypted with 3des-cbc, no compression
server may send data encrypted with arcfour, zlib compression

MSG_KEXINIT may be sent at any time during session
"Re-keying" may change compression, ciphers as well as keys

Once keyed, protocol moves on to authentication
