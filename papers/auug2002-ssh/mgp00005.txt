SSH Protocol


Runs on TCP port 22, initiated by client

Client and server exchange banners at connect time:
SSH-1.5-SoftwareName	=> SSH protocol v.1
SSH-2.0-SoftwareName	=> SSH protocol v.2
SSH-1.99-SoftwareName	=> both protocols

SoftwareName is the implementation name and version
Usually used for backwards (bug) compatibility

Server always has a public/private key pair
Public key is sent during connection setup
Server's public key is cached by client to detect MITM
