<h1>LibreSSL: More Than 30 Days Later</h1>
Ted Unangst<p>
tedu@openbsd.org<p>

LibreSSL was officially announced to the world just about exactly five months
ago. Bob spoke at BSDCan about the first 30 days. For those who weren't there,
I'll quickly rehash some of that material. Also, it's always best to start at
the beginning, but then I'll try to focus on some new material and updates.

<h1>openssl</h1>

LibreSSL is a fork of the popular OpenSSL crypto and TLS library. TLS is the
standard name for the successor to SSL, that other secure transport protocol
developed in the 90s. Most notably used for https, but also secure
imap/smtp/etc. I'd guess there's far more traffic protected by TLS than any
other means. There are several implementations around, but two that dominate,
at least in the C universe. OpenSSL is the de facto standard for servers and
many clients. The alternative is NSS, the Netscape Security Services library,
used by both Firefox and Chrome, but not many other clients. Oh, if you didn't
upgrade NSS last week, you should go do that.
<p>
Cryptography in general and TLS in particular are pretty difficult to get
right. So a monoculture isn't strictly a bad thing. Put all your eggs in one
basket, and then watch that basket very carefully, right? Unfortunately, the
OpenSSL basket was being watched somewhat less than very carefully. Yeah, it
has bugs, but surely somebody else will fix them. And worst case scenario,
since everybody uses the same library, everybody will be affected by the bugs.
Nobody wants to be alone.

<h1>heartbleed</h1>

Fast forward past a hundred other vulns to Heartbleed, also known as the worst
bug ever, though that title is heavily contested. I hear even bash has
announced it is entering the contest.
<p>
What was unusual about Heartbleed? It's a vulnerability, not an exploit, with
a name (and a website!). Previously we'd seen The Internet Worm (when there
was only one), then Code Red, Blaster, Stuxnet. They all used various
exploits, but the vulnerabilities didn't have names. Heartbleed can't even be
considered the worst OpenSSL vuln. Previous bugs have resulted in remote code
execution. Anybody remember the Slapper worm? That worm exploited an OpenSSL
bug (which was apparently titled the SSLv2 client master key buffer overflow)
which revealed not only encrypted data or your private key, but also gave up a
remote shell on the server, and then it propogated itself. Yeah, I'd say
that's worse. But no headlines.
<p>
I mention this just to reinforce that LibreSSL is not the result of "the worst
bug ever". I may call you dirty names, but I'm not going to fork your project
on the basis of a missing bounds check.

<h1>why fork</h1>

Instead, libressl is here because of a tragic comedy of other errors. Let's
start with the obvious. Why were heartbeats, a feature only useful for the
DTLS protocol over UDP, built into the TLS protocol that runs over TCP? And
why was this entirely useless feature enabled by default? Then there's some
nonsense with the buffer allocator and freelists and exploit mitigation countermeasures, and
we keep on digging and we keep on not liking what we're seeing. Bob's talk has all
the gory details.
<p>
But why fork? Why not start from scratch? Why not start with some other
contender? We did look around a bit, but sadly the state of affairs is that
the other contenders aren't so great themselves. Not long before Heartbleed,
you may recall Apple dealing with goto fail, aka the worst bug ever,
but actually about par for the course.

<h1>libressl</h1>

What did we do? We gutted the junk. We started rewriting lots of functions. We
added some cool new crypto support, for things like ChaCha20.

<h1>posix</h1>

I could spend an hour explaining why supporting obsolete broken systems is
detrimental, but if I told you all the things I have learned about VMS, it
would probably violate your human rights. Instead, I think one example will suffice.
<p>
<pre>
#ifdef FIONBIO
	/* working code */
#else
	/* crappy workaround */
#endif
</pre>
<p>
In theory, this looks like we're going to use the good code on a posix system.
But there's just one problem. The code is testing for FIONBIO, which is only
defined if you include the right header. If you forget to include the right
header, the compiler falls back to the workaround. The mere existence of
workarounds means they can be picked up accidentally, and you'll never know.

<h1>socklen_t</h1>

OK, I lied. The socklen_t workaround is just too horrible to skip over. Also,
I love this picture.
<p>
<img src="why-must-life-be-hard.gif">
<p>
Here's a problem. You want to create a variable the same size as socklen_t.
One fairly obvious solution would be to declare a variable of type socklen_t.
That's not how OpenSSL does things, however. Instead, let's create a union of
a couple different ints, call accept(), then inspect the different union
members to determine which ones were overwritten by the kernel. Oh, and don't
forget to check for big endian versus little endian.

<h1>optionmania</h1>

The problem extends beyond just legacy compat code. Even new code in OpenSSL
can be a byzantine mess.  I'm going to point out two config options for
OpenSSL, but they're pretty much all like this.
<p>
<pre>
#define OPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS
#define OPENSSL_NO_BUF_FREELISTS
</pre>
<p>
First, the naming convention alone reveals the on by default mentality. Everything
is on, you have to pick and choose what to disable. Second, this makes testing
for such options problematic. Old versions without the feature don't have the
define to disable the feature. Even more bizarrely, this means that future
releases of LibreSSL will have to track these defines and continue adding more
of them for every new feature we decide not to import. We plan on not adding
support for many more features to come.

<h1>apply the brakes</h1>

Slowing down development is a big part of what we're doing. We're trying to
present a smaller target, not a bigger target. So we've applied the brakes on
new development.
<p>
I'm going to pick on the FreeBSD guys here for a bit, but it's not their
fault.
<p>
2014-08-06 OpenSSL advisory<br>
2014-09-09 FreeBSD advisory
<p>
What were you guys doing? Oh, that's right. You were probably wading through
the 13,000 lines of diff that OpenSSL decided to drop as part of the new
release.
<p>
Projects need to consider how downstream users will actually deal with their
copiuous volume of security patches. This goes back to how did heartbeats get
into the ecosystem? Because nobody could keep track of what's going on.
<p>
That's not to say LibreSSL development is frozen. We've added support for a
few new ciphers, notably chacha20. As we do so, though, we consider what new
possible failure modes we may introduce. I wouldn't put a buffer overflow
outside the realm of possibility when implementing a cipher, but it's pretty
unusual. The inputs to a cipher are quite well defined with little room for
error. 

<h1>SRP</h1>

Let's look at another timeline.
<p>
May 5 - Remove libssl SRP<br>
Jul 2 - CVE-2014-5139 (ssl) discovered<br>
Jul 28 - Remove libcrypto SRP<br>
Jul 31 - CVE-2014-5139 (crypto) discovered<br>
Aug 6 - OpenSSL 1.0.1i<br>
Aug 8 - Bug report SRP is broken<br>
<p>
On May 5, I removed all the SRP code from
libssl, along with kerberos and some other protocol extensions. The problem is
that this code is integrated by sprinkling a dozen ifdefs and crazy nested
if/else chains into functions that do some pretty critical things, like decide
how to exchange keys between client and server. Auditing these 1000 line
monoliths was clearly impossible, so we cut down to the basics. The SRP code
in libcrypto was left alone because it wasn't directly in the way.
<p>
On July 2, OpenSSL received notification about a crash causing bug in the TLS
SRP code, but this was not publicly known. On July 28, I deleted the
libcrypto SRP code as well. In my commit message, I mentioned "hey there's a
bug in here, but the details are secret." This was actually kind of misleading
because the secret bug was in a different library, in code that had already
been removed.
<p>
Three days later, on July 31, two researchers found a remotely expoitable
buffer overflow in the libcrypto SRP code. This is like "throw a rock; you're
guaranteed to hit something." Even when you point people in the wrong
direction, they still find bugs.
<p>
On August 6, 1.0.1i was released with fixes for both of the above issues along
with about 12800 lines of diff for other stuff. On August 8, a user reported
that after upgrading, SRP no longer worked. The fix for the first issue was
broken. The bug was embargoed for over a month, and nobody tested the fix.
<p>
What's the lesson here? Don't drop jumbo security patches on users. Anybody
actually using SRP was in an unfortunate pickle here. They couldn't upgrade to
get the fix for the buffer overflow, but instead had to pick it out from the
rest. If the patches had been issued separately, as they were discovered, this
never would have happened. Nobody's perfect, and I've flubbed a few patches
myself, but that's exactly why you don't combine them. If the libssl patch had
been released at the beginning of July, the regression would have been
discovered and a correct fix hammered out long before the buffer overflow was
discovered.

<h1>months 2-5</h1>

OK, I still haven't talked too much about we have done since the last update.
We've mostly stopped deleting code. There's still some scary code left, but
the good news is it's code you need to run. There was a bit of a summer lull,
some post hackathon decompression, and then the OpenBSD 5.6 freeze. But
progress is picking up again. Dig into a directory, open a few files, rewrite
a function or two. Look at all the points where memory is allocated, and then
make sure it is freed, exactly one time, no more, no less.
<p>
I'm sorry to make it all sound so tame, but avoiding excitement is all part of
the plan. The first 30 days were all about revolution. Now we've switched into
evolution mode.

<h1>portable</h1>

Due to quirks of release timing, the first release of LibreSSL was the
portable version. The first native OpenBSD version won't be released until
November, when 5.6 comes out.
<p>
I personally do not work on the portable version, but I have kept my eye on
it. A few notes on that. First, you'll be happy to know that libressl portable
should work on all BSD systems. It works on some other systems, too, but
enough about them. Most of the extensioned interfaces in OpenBSD are already
shared with other BSDs. You shouldn't even need the portable build system, if
you don't like it. The simple BSD makefile build system from OpenBSD will
probably suit you better.
<p>
That's the good news. The bad news, for now, is
that libressl uses the arc4random function to generate random numbers. Theo has
a talk coming up all about that, but it's enough for me to say that the
arc4random implementations in FreeBSD and NetBSD aren't quite state of the art
anymore. I know there are some patches to update FreeBSD at least, but they've
stalled out. You're going to want to pick that work up.
<p>
We're currently still targeting posix platforms. Windows support isn't out of
the question.

<h1>ressl</h1>

I'd like to turn now to what I hope is the future. The initial reactions to
the announcement of LibreSSL included a lot of "the OpenSSL API is so bad it's
not worth preserving". I'm inclined to agree. We've preserved the API because
that's what we needed to do to succeed, but we're not married to it long term.
<p>
Joel and I have been working on a replacement API for OpenSSL, appropriately
entitled ressl. Reimagined SSL is how I think of it. Our goals are consistency
and simplicity. In particular, we answer the question "What would the user
like to do?" and not "What does the TLS protocol allow the user to do?". You
can make a secure connection to a server. You can host a secure server. You
can read and write some data over that connection.
<p>
A few goals. First, no OpenSSL types or functions are exposed. In fact, not
even any ressl internals are exposed. You should never need to contemplate
X.509 or ASN.1. Those are implementation details far beyond the level of
caring of most developers or users.  As a consequence of that, the API is easy
for other languges to bind to.  The ressl interface could almost equally well
describe transport over ssh tunnels. What do you want? Do you want a secure
connection? We give you a secure connection.
<p>
Perhaps more importantly, it allows the implementation to evolve and change.
It's not actually tied to LibreSSL. The libressl library will work with
OpenSSL, and can be adapted to use other implementations as well. Previous
efforts at replacing OpenSSL usually ended up with compat shims that
replicated the OpenSSL API. But that's terrible. If we're going to have a
universal API, it needs to be a good one. And it needs to be sufficiently
abstract so that others are welcome to the party. Clearly, we've made a claim
that LibreSSL is, or at least can be, the best quality TLS stack you can get.
But I think the ecosystem benefits by breaking the monoculture.
<p>
The ressl API does provide one noteworthy feature. Hostname verification. In
order to make a secure TLS connection, you must do two things. Validate the
certificate and its trust chain. Then verify that the hostname in the cert
matches the hostname you've connected to. Lots of people don't do the latter
because OpenSSL doesn't do that latter. You have to do it yourself, which
requires knowing about things like CommonNames and SubjectAltNames. The
good news is that popular bindings for languages like python and ruby include
a function to verify the hostname. The bad news is if you pick a python or
ruby project at random, they probably forget to do it. Another funny fact is
that since everybody has to write this code themselves, everybody does it a
little bit differently. Especially regarding handling of wildcard certificates
and everybody's favorite, embedded nul bytes. Hostname verification is on by
default in ressl, and the API is designed so that you always provide a
hostname; there's no way to accidentally call the function that doesn't do
verification.
<p>
We have the advantage that we can evolve the client and server APIs in sync
with at least two test programs, the OpenBSD ftp client and httpd. We're not
nearly ready to call for third party support; that's probably a few months
away.

<h1>QA</h1>

Q: Where should we discuss changes to the ressl API?
<p>
A: The code is in cvs and can be discussed on the tech@ mailing list.
