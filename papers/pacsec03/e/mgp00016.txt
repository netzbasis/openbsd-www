Guard pages


Concept:  Put an unmapped page between all allocations
Like "Electric Fencing"

In malloc()
malloc.conf 'G' option makes page allocations be guarded

In mmap()

Some application breakage
This is when we find out how much "Open Source" is garbage
Much software accesses beyond the end of an object, off-by-one
Mozilla
... I do not want to make a list

Wastes some virtual address space
