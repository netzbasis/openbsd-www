Future - routing priorities

additional routing preference metric is added
every routing source has a defined type

abuse multipath code
routes are sorted by priority
ascending order

on addition / deletion of routes a priority needs to be specified
routing socket selects a type if none is specified
route delete behaves strange because of this

basic functionality is implemented but ...
        magic and some dragons are still in the way
