Future - routing priorities

routing daemons need to keep their tables in sync

different preference (priority) in case of conflicts
OSPF is preferred over BGP

synchronisation in userland is difficult
race conditions
all daemons must obey a global policy
routing socket is lossy!

Kernel manages the different routing sources
decides which is the most preferred route
kernel routing table is always in sync
userland daemons don't need to know about each other
