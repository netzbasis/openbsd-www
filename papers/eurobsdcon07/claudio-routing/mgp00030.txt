Future - VRF support

Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)
running multiple routing instances on one box

with new routing messages possible to implement

interface (struct ifnet) needs a default routing table id

modify arp code to support multiple routing tables
same for IPv6 as well

support cross VRF routing
abusing pf?
implementing special loopback interface?
