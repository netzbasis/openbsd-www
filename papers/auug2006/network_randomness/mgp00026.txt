OpenBSD Implementation
TCP Timestamp

Constraints
Initial value can be random, must increase at a constant rate

32 bits from arc4random()

RFC1323 designers really missed the opportunity to make this a solid security feature. Should have:
Explicitly stated that the timer could vary per connection
Required connections using timestamps to use them on all packets
