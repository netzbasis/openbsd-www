An example: TCP Reset Spoofing

"Slipping in the Window", Paul T. Watson (2004)

Summary: TCP window scaling makes it much easier to guess a valid sequence number.

Primary Target: long-lived TCP connections on boxes with not many connections over time and predictable source ports... like, say, bgp on Cisco routers!
