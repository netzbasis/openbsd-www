OpenBSD Implementation
The TIME_WAIT problem Cont.

Primarily affects very heavy users:
Benchmarking tools and simulated traffic
Reverse web proxies
Busy nat systems
users all connecting to the same destination

Steve Bellovin proposes a solution in RFC 1948:

ISN = timer + F(localhost, localport, remotehost, remoteport);
where F is function that can not be computed from the outside
ie. a keyed hash

Rekeying is an issue, however
