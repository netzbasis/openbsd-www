What can we improve?
Security and robustness

Handling of poorly defined protocols
Tradeoff against interoperability
eg. Weak wording of RFC 1323
Need other OS's to help push for change
For examples, come to my network randomness talk

Performance under worst-case conditions
High packet rate (NOT bandwidth)
Large numbers of connections
