Security and Robustness
Denial of Service Attack Mitigation

Caveat: very difficult to combat bandwidth-based DDoS

There are two major problems:
Ruleset evaluation costs (packets per second which don't match an existing connection)
Memory pressure: Number of concurrent connections

Techniques include:
synproxy
adaptive timeouts
max-src-states and max-src-nodes
max-src-conn and max-src-conn-rate
Input queue congestion handling
ALTQ
