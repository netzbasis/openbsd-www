Twelve years ago OpenBSD developers started engineering
a release process that has resulted in quality software
being delivered on a consistent 6 month schedule -- 25 times
in a row, exactly on the date promised, and with no critical
bugs.  This on-time delivery process is very different from
how corporations manage their product releases and much more
in tune with how volunteer driven communities are supposed
to function.  Developer and testing laziness is mostly
circumvented and leader frustration is kept to a minimum.  The
reasons, mechanics and social workings of our process have
never been detailed outside the project, but now will be,
hopefully providing some insight to others who face delays
and quality issues with their own product lines.
