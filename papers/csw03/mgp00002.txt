The DARPA grant


DARPA gave us a grant about 18 months ago, 6 months to go

$2.3 million USD or so...

We were going to do this security work anyway..
but this grant accelerates our efforts significantly

DARPA does not tell us what to do, or get something extra

Thanks to Jonathan M. Smith (upenn) and Angelos Keromytis
(columbia) for negotiating this

Pays for stuff
6 fulltime hackers...
some hardware
a 40+ person week-long hackathon a year

Slaves to implement my ideas!
