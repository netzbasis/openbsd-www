i386 PROT_EXEC real X bit


Most x86 cpu use a split-TLB in their MMU already

PTE has 3 unused bits: normally used by software

Our kernel tracks X bit per-page using PT_AVAIL3

Used to determine where CS limit should be (highest PT_AVAIL3 page is included)

If these cpu had a mode (PTX), could do X bit

code fetch fault: If PTX && (pte & PT_AVAIL3) == 0 -> fault

150 gates, or approx 4 lines of microcode

VIA and AMD are receptive, still trying to build contacts at Intel and Transmeta
