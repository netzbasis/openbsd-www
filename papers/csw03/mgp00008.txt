Setuid Culling


We used to ship with approx 40 setuid binaries

We now ship with about 8 of consequence

that means "they still scare me a bit"

chfn, login, passwd, rsh, su, sudo, lockspool, authpf

Most of these are about 50 - 300 lines of code

This was done by

using more groups
new user id's
a fair amount of code rewrite

We also managed to get rid of numerous setgid programs
