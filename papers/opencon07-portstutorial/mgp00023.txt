Step 5 - extract

This will extract the downloaded distfile into ${WRKOBJDIR}/iodine-0.4.0/iodine-0.4.0.

$ make extract
===>  Checking files for iodine-0.4.0
`/usr/ports/distfiles/iodine-0.4.0.tar.gz' is up to date.
>> (SHA256) iodine-0.4.0.tar.gz: OK
===>  Extracting for iodine-0.4.0
$

The extract target will resolve all dependencies beforehand by installing all required programs first.

Since we haven't specified any dependencies yet, nothing gets installed.
