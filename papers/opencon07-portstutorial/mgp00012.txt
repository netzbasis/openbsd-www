Set up your work environment (cont.)

/etc/mk.conf

SUDO=/usr/bin/sudo
Some operations during a port build require root privileges. If the SUDO variable is set to /usr/bin/sudo you can build ports as a regular user. (assuming sudo is set up)

PLIST_DB=${PORTSDIR}/plist
If this variable is set, pkg_create(1) will save a copy of the generated packinglists in the specified directory. This is useful to detect missing PKGNAME bumps etc.
