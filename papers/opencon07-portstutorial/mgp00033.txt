Step 12 - plist

The application got correctly installed into the fake area.

Now it's time to create a packaging list.

$ make plist
===>  Updating plist for iodine-0.4.0
/usr/ports/mystuff/net/iodine/pkg/PLIST is new
$

$ cat pkg/PLIST

The plist target scanned the fake area and created a packaging list.

You don't have to create these lists by hand. The tool behind the plist target will just do the right thing. (most of the time...)
