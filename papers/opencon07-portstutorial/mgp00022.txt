Step 4 - makesum/checksum

To create the distinfo file, we will execute the following command.
$ make makesum
===>  Checking files for iodine-0.4.0
`/usr/ports/distfiles/iodine-0.4.0.tar.gz' is up to date.
$

To verify that the hashes are correctly written to the file we can use:

$ make checksum
===>  Checking files for iodine-0.4.0
`/usr/ports/distfiles/iodine-0.4.0.tar.gz' is up to date.
>> (SHA256) iodine-0.4.0.tar.gz: OK
$
