Step 13 - port-lib-depends-check (cont.)

After we added the WANTLIB line to our Makefile, we have to re-check the dependencies.

$ make port-lib-depends-check 
iodine-0.4.0:
$

It looks like we correctly recorded all dependencies.

In this case we only have two library dependencies from the base system.
Most ports have many more dependencies, though.

Look for LIB_DEPENDS, RUN_DEPENDS and BUILD_DEPENDS in the documentation and existing ports.
