Step 14 - DESCR

The last thing we have to do before we actually can build the package is to create a DESCR file with a brief description of the application.

$ cat <<__EOF > pkg/DESCR                               
> This is a piece of software that lets you tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS
> server. It can be usable in different situations where internet access
> is firewalled, but DNS queries are allowed.
> __EOF
