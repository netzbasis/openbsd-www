Step 7 - configure

If the application source code contains a configure script you have to set CONFIGURE_STYLE=gnu in the Makefile.

The configure target will run iogens configure script to analyze your system and check for dependecies.

It's a constant source of errors, so you have to watch its output very closely.

This will sometimes pick up stuff like shared libraries from other installed packages and thus create hidden dependencies.

We are lucky, iodine doesn't include a configure script.
