Set up your work environment (cont.)

Before you can start to work with the ports tree you have to check it out of CVS.

Select an anoncvs mirror nearby and execute the following commands:

$ cd /usr
$ cvs -d anoncvs@mirror:/cvs co -P ports
U ports/.cvsignore
U ports/INDEX
...

This will checkout the -current ports tree to your machine.
