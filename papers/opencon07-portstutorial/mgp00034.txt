Step 13 - port-lib-depends-check

The package tools need some assistance to build the dependency chain of a package.

That means we have to record the dependencies in the Makefile.
Fortunately, there is a nice make(1) target to help us with this task.

$ make port-lib-depends-check
iodine-0.4.0:
WANTLIB:       c.42 (/usr/local/sbin/iodined) (system lib)
WANTLIB:       z.4 (/usr/local/sbin/iodined) (system lib)
        WANTLIB += c z
*** Error code 1 (ignored)
$

As we can see, iodine depends on two libraries from the base system.
The last line before the Error shows us what needs to be added to the Makefile.
