ROP coding function - call this to jump anywhere!
An assembly function that allows you to jump to any arbitrary address in a program - this is a ROP coders dream - and it's in regular OpenSSL.

"Weaponized" Comic Sans:

"This page scientifically designed to annoy web hipsters - donate now"

Actually quite sad that far more people will express their outrage over the use of Comic Sans on a web site than reading the asn1 code and expressing their outrage over that.
