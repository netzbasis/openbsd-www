What are we looking for?

We are looking for funding commitment to:

Sponsor several developers to re-write some key pieces of the codebase

Sponsor some efforts of the portability/ports people to track the effects of changes through the ports tree and push changes upstream. 

In a nutshell, a significant funding commitment for a couple of years. We would like to speed the rewite of this library but not at the expense of our usual resources to maintain OpenBSD, OpenSSH and related projects. 

Yes we have asked the Linux Foundation. They have not yet committed to support us.
