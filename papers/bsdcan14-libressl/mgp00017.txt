Entropy - really - this library should not do this.

OpenSSL's attempt to be a random subsystem resulted in all sorts of horrors:

EGD considered harmful - really, userland has no business in this.

Library can decide "Oh Noes, We need something random..." and then: 
Your RSA Private key is pretty random
char seed[] = "String to Give the Random Number Generator Randomness";
getpid();
gettimeofday();

Since many of these were always "there" - these become an attack target - modify the word to enable them and you have predictable key generation.
