Move the library to use intrinsics. 

While we can't remove things like BIO_snprintf and CRYPTO_malloc (they are exposed API) we can stop using them ourselves.

We are moving the library to use only regular intrinsic functions, malloc, calloc, realloc, snprintf, strlcat, internally. The strange API's will remain for now only to maintain compatibility with external applications that use them.

Result, instead of OPENSSL_strfoo or CRYPTO_membar, we end up with the normal, intrinsic functions that nobody needs to be surprised how they work. 

Normal POSIX API use => more and easier developer involvement.
