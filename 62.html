    </ul>

<p>
<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>/
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> improvements:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmctl.8">vmctl(8)</a> supports paused VM migration and memory snapshotting using send and receive commands.
    <li>VPID/ASID reuse/rollover in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>.
    <li>SGABIOS imported as an option ROM payload in SeaBIOS (for VGA to serial console redirection.)
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> resets the guest VM RTC (real time clock) on host resume from suspend/hibernate (OpenBSD guests only.)
    <li>Allow guest VMs access to AVX/AVX2 host CPU features
    <li>Support for AMD SVM/RVI hosts
    <li>Allow larger guest VM memory sizes (up to MAXDSIZ sized guests - eg, 32GB on amd64 hosts)
    <li>Better handling of guest VM MONITOR/MWAIT and HLT instructions
    <li>Various device emulation improvements in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>.
    <li>Increase the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/virtio.4">virtio(4)</a> queue size provided by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> from 64 to 128 entries, to increase performance.
    <li>Many fixes to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmctl.8">vmctl(8)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> error handling.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>IEEE 802.11 wireless stack improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>MiRA 802.11n TX rate scaling now supports devices with unequal numbers of Tx and Rx streams. Fixes 11n mode for some <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/athn.8">athn(8)</a> devices.
    <li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwn.8">iwn(8)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.8">iwm(8)</a> drivers will now start scanning for a new access point if they no longer receive beacons from their current AP.
    <li>Prefer the 5GHz band over the 2GHz band during access point selection.
    <li>Improved debug output in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dmesg.8">dmesg(8)</a> when a wireless interface is put into debug mode with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Generic network stack improvements:
    <ul>
    <li> Incoming and forwarded IP packets are now processed without
         KERNEL_LOCK, resulting in better performances and reduced latency
    <li> The kernel no longer handles IPv6 Stateless Address
         Autoconfiguration (RFC 4862), allowing cleanup and simplification
         of the IPv6 network stack.
    <li> The kernel sends IPv6 router solicitations for link local addresses
         with a link local source address.
    <li> FQ-CoDel algorithm has been implemented for use with <a
         href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf#QUEUEING">pf(4) queueing</a>.
    <li>Improve IPv6 checks for IPsec policies and make them consistent
	with IPv4.
    <li>Refactor local IP delivery to process IPsec packets in a flow.
	Avoid that they are enqueued a second time.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a>
	looks into AH packets and matches on the inner protocol.
	This makes IPv4 authentication headers work like IPv6.
    <li>The length of extension header chains in pf(4) is limited.
	This prevents spending excessive cpu time on crafted packets.
    <li>Block IPv6 packets in pf(4) that have hop-by-hop options
	header or destination options header.
	Such packets can be passed by adding "allow-opts" to the
	rule.
	So IPv6 options are handled like their counterpart in IPv4
	now.
    <li>If the IPv4 ID gets reused too fast, pf(4) fragment reassembly
	uses a smarter strategy to drop packets.
    <li>Enable the use of per-CPU caches on the network packet allocators
    <li>...
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Installer improvements:
    <ul>
    <li> The installer now uses the Allotment Routing Table (ART).
    <li> A unique kernel is now created by the installer to boot from after install/upgrade.
    <li> On release installs of architectures supported by syspatch "syspatch -c" is added to rc.firsttime.
    <li> Backwards compatibility code to support the 'rtsol' keyword in hostname.if(5) has been removed.
    <li> The install.site and upgrade.site scripts are now executed at the end of the install/upgrade process.
    <li> More detailed information is shown to identify disks.
    <li> The IPv6 default router selection has been fixed.
    <li> On the amd64 platform, the AES-NI is used if present.
    <li>...
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
    <ul>
    <li> A new daemon, <a
         href="https://man.openbsd.org/slaacd.8">slaacd(8)</a> handles IPv6
         Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (RFC 4862).
    <li> <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rtadvd.8">rtadvd(8)</a> now supports
         "Reducing Energy Consumption of Router Advertisements" (RFC 7772).
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rtadvd.8">rtadvd(8)</a> has
      been fixed to quickly handle IPv6 prefixes changes on the system.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsecctl.8">ipsecctl(8)</a>
	can show SA bundles now.
	The keyword "bundle" allows to create them explicitly.
	This avoids confusion as they were used implicitly before.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a>
        has got the option -W "recvlimit" to terminate netcat after
        receiving a number of packets.
        This allows to send a UDP request, receive a reply and check
        the result on the command line.
    <li>Fix a bunch of races in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>
	expecially in HTTP chunked mode.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ndp.8">ndp(8)</a> shows the
      relevant NDP information when run in a non-default routing
      domain.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifstated.8">ifstated(8)</a> now
      copes with interface departures/arrivals.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a> can now
      be started multiple times in different
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rdomain.4">routing domains</a>,
      this provides virtual router functionality.
    <li>...
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Security improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>A new function
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/freezero.3">freezero(3)</a>
	to easily clear and free memory holding sensitive data has been added.
    <li>Double free detection has been improved when the F
    	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a> option is used.
    	The existing S option now includes F.
    <li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tty.4#TIOCSTI">TIOCSTI</a>
	tty ioctl has been removed.  The I/O-loops in the last two consumers
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/csh.1">csh(1)</a> and
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mail.1">mail(1)</a>
	were rewritten to cope with the removal.
    <li>Trapsleds, a new mitigation that significantly reduces the amount of
        nops in the instruction stream, replacing them with trap instructions
        or jump-over-trap sequences, thereby requiring greater accuracy for
        targetting potential gadgets.
    <li>Kernel Address Randomized Link (KARL), a new "link-kit" allows the .o
        files of the kernel to be relinked in a random order, creating a unique
        kernel for each boot.  /bsd is now non-readable to users, to try to
        keep the secret.
    <li>Like with libc previously,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a> re-links libcrypto on
        startup, placing the objects in a random order.
    <li>In addition to libcrypto, to deter code reuse exploits,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a> re-links
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so.1">ld.so</a> on
        startup, placing the objects in a random order.
    <li>If process accounting is activated with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/accton.8">accton(8)</a>,
	the daily mail shows pledge violations and program crashes.
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lastcomm.8">lastcomm(8)</a>
	uses the flags P and T for such processes.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pflogd.8">pflogd(8)</a> uses the
	fork+exec model.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump.8">tcpdump(8)</a> uses the
	fork+exec model.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifstated.8">ifstated(8)</a>
      uses <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a>.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpd(8)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpctl(8)</a> now use
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a>.
    <li>Tighter pledge for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/at.1">at(1)</a>.
    <li>Fixed and simplified pledge logic for
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a>.
    <li>More application of recallocarray(3) in userland, and tracked sizes
        to free(9) in the kernel.
    <li>Achieve higher levels of paranoia regarding structure packing, and
        clear many kernel objects before passing to userland.
    <li>Disable some optimizations in clang(1) due to incompatibility
        with security.
    <li>For instance, cope with clang(1)'s assumption that static or const
        objects placed in unknown sections (such as .openbsd.randomdata)
        are surely always 0, and therefore such memory accesses can be
        optimized away..
    <li>In kernel, randomly bias down the top-of-stack per kthread.
    </ul>
<p>

<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.8">dhcpd(8)</a>/
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay.8">dhcrelay(8)</a> improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>Add support for echo-client-id statement to
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.conf.5">dhclient.conf(5)</a>.
    <li>Take greater care to process all data read, and only data read, from the
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bpf.4">bpf(4)</a>
      socket.
    <li>Use /dev/bpf instead of /dev/bpf0.
    <li>Handle DHCPINFORM messages from clients behind a DHCP relay.
    <li>Fix handling of
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/carp.4">carp(4)</a>
      interfaces in
       <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay.8">dhcrelay(8)</a>.
    <li>Don't stop
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay.8">dhcrelay(8)</a>
      logging to stderr when it is started with the -d option.
    </ul>
<p>
    
<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a> improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>Log messages reworked and clarified, in particular by prefixing
	the name of the relevant network interface.
    <li>Treat SSID as 0 to 32 bytes of binary data, not a string.
    <li>Use RTM_PROPOSAL to take control of an interface rather than flipping
      interface down and up in the hope that other
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a>
      instances notice.
    <li>Reduce file operations needed by -L option by opening file at
      startup and using it throughout process lifetime.
    <li>Improve <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolv.conf.5">resolv.conf(5)</a>
      handling by reducing writes and more reliably determining which interface
      has the current default route.
    <li>Take greater care to process all data read, and only data read, from the
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bpf.4">bpf(4)</a>
      socket.
    <li>Improve the determination of the link state of an interface.
    <li>Decline inappropriate lease offers as soon as they are deemed
      inappropriate.
    <li>Drop support for the timestamp formats used in lease files created
      more than four years ago.
    <li>Accept an offer from the server that sent the first copy of
      the offer, not the server that sent the last copy.
    <li>Don't delete addresses and routes when exiting.
    <li>Ensure IPv6 packets are not read from sockets.
    <li>Don't silently ignore obsolete keywords in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">dhclient.conf(5)</a>
    <li>Reduce memory footprint by shrinking oversized static buffers.
    <li>Eliminate repeated socket opens by opening the required sockets during
      startup.
    <li>Fix construction of unicast UDP packets, broken in 5.6.
    <li>Improve determination of when a renewed lease requires interface
      configuration changes.
    <li>Don't exit when addresses are manually added or deleted from an
      interface.
    <li>Don't support option 33, classfull IP addresses.
    <li>Fix configuration of default routes supplied by classless route options.
    <li>Consider
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">dhclient.conf(5)</a>
      contents when determining what MTU value to configure.
    <li>Consider
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">dhclient.conf(5)</a>
      contents when creating the content of
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolv.conf.5">resolv.conf(5)</a>.
    <li>Delete direct routes when routes are flushed.
    <li>Don't label routes with "DHCLIENT nnnn".
    <li>Don't delete addresses or routes that will be immediately added back.
    <li>Delete addresses and routes only when a renewal request is NAK'ed.
    <li>Don't wait forever for requested information on the default route.
    <li>Don't exit when an attempt to send a packet fails.
    <li>Don't log a packet send when the send fails.
    <li>Remove the -u option, broken since 2013 without complaints.
    <li>Use /dev/bpf instead of /dev/bpf0.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Assorted improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/i386.html">i386</a> and
        <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html">amd64</a>
        platforms have switched to using
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang-local.1">clang(1)</a>
        as the base system compiler.
    <li>Improved UTF-8 line editing support for

        a plain text format. Support for the
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh#HISTCONTROL">HISTCONTROL</a>
        environment variable was added.
    <li>The performance of the memory deallocator used by
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a> has been fixed.
    <li>The <tt>emacs-usemeta</tt> <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a>
      flag is no longer needed and is now deprecated.
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/futex">futex(2)</a> syscall.
    <li>New pthread
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pthread_mutex_init">mutex</a> and
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pthread_cond_init">condition
        variable</a> implementations improving latency
        of threaded applications.
    <li>New POSIX <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/newlocale.3">xlocale</a>
        implementation written from scratch, complete in the sense that
        all POSIX *locale(3) and *_l(3) functions are included, but in
        OpenBSD, we of course only really care about <code>LC_CTYPE</code>
        and we only support ASCII and UTF-8.
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ctfdump">ctfdump(1)</a> and
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ctfconv">ctfconv(1)</a>
        tools to manipulate CTF (Compact C Type Format).
    <li>The error handling in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/syslogd.8">syslogd(8)</a>
	has been improved.
	Even if internal errors occur, the daemon tries to keep
	unaffected subsystems active.
	So as many messages as possible are logged.
	They can be filtered by severity and facility "syslog".
    <li>syslogd(8) can now suppress "last message repeated" which is
	useful for remote logging.
    <li>syslogd(8) can listen on multiple TLS sockets.
    <li>syslogd(8) closes the *.514 UDP sockets when they are not
	needed.
    <li>Truncate log messates at 8192 bytes everywhere.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/newsyslog.8">newsyslog(8)</a>
      now skips and logs invalid config lines.
    <li>Nested mount points are umounted in correct order.
    <li>Fix creation of
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
      CONCAT volumes.
    <li>Include
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
      volume and backing disk information in i/o error messages.
    <li>Make
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vioscsi.4">vioscsi(4)</a>
      a normal
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scsi.4">scsi(4)</a>
      device by eliminating its use of the obsolete XS_NO_CCB mechanism.
    <li>Remove last vestiges of now unused XS_NO_CCB mechanism.
    <li>Userspace can now get the address of the thread control block
        without a system call on OCTEON II and later.
    <li>FPU is enabled on OCTEON III.
    <li>GENERIC kernels now include a .SUNW_ctf section containing CTF data
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> <tt>kill</tt>
    command, send an uncatchable SIGABRT to a process.
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> <tt>pprint</tt>
    command, using CTF information to "pretty print" global symbols.
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a>
    <tt>show struct</tt> command, using CTF information to display the content
    of in memory C structures.
    <li>x86: <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> uses CTF data
    to display the correct number of function arguments in backtraces
    <li>Power off all codecs in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/azalia.4">azalia(4)</a> to avoid static
      noise in speakers and headphones on reboot.
    <li>Fix i386 boot regression seen on very old 486DX CPUs. 
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/witness.4">witness(4)</a> tool
        for debugging lock order issues in the kernel.
        The tool is not built in by default, and only amd64, hppa and i386
        are supported.
    <li>Modernize some bizzare tty behaviours of getty(8).
    <li>Some subtle changes to pledge(2) to satisfy requirements observed
        in real life. 
    <li>Prefer use of waitpid(2) rather than wait(3) where possible, to
        avoid problems with pre-existing children.
    <li>Rewrite swaths of machine-dependent system call stub code in ld.so(1)
        in a more portable fashion.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pool_cache_init.9">Per-CPU

      for all requests and macros and support creation of syntax tree
      nodes in the roff(7) parser, allowing support for many new
      low-level roff(7) features.
      Only about 25 ports still need <code>USE_GROFF</code> now.
    <li>Many improvements to

      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7">mdoc(7)</a>
      <code>.Lk</code> macro.
    <li>Some CSS improvements in HTML output, in particular for the

<h3 id="upgrade"><font color="#0000e0">How to upgrade</font></h3>

If you already have an OpenBSD 6.1 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade62.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
<p>

<hr>

<h3 id="sourcecode"><font color="#0000e0">Notes about the source code</font></h3>

<tt>src.tar.gz</tt> contains a source archive starting at <tt>/usr/src</tt>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mkdir -p /usr/src</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<tt>sys.tar.gz</tt> contains a source archive starting at <tt>/usr/src/sys</tt>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<h3 id="ports"><font color="#0000e0">Ports Tree</font></h3>

A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the <i>-stable</i> branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/ports</b>
# <b>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_6_2</b>
</pre></blockquote>

[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 6.2 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
