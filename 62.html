    </ul>

<p>
<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>/
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> improvements:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmctl.8">vmctl(8)</a> supports
        paused VM migration and memory snapshotting using send and receive commands.
    <li>VPID/ASID reuse/rollover in <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>.
    <li>SGABIOS imported as an option ROM payload in SeaBIOS (for VGA to serial
        console redirection).
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> resets the
        guest VM RTC (real time clock) on host resume from suspend/hibernate
        (OpenBSD guests only).
    <li>Allow guest VMs access to AVX/AVX2 host CPU features.
    <li>Support for AMD SVM/RVI hosts.

        32GB on amd64 hosts).
    <li>Better handling of guest VM MONITOR/MWAIT and HLT instructions.
    <li>Various device emulation improvements in <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>.
    <li>Increase the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/virtio.4">virtio(4)</a>
        queue size provided by <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> from 64 to 128 entries, to increase performance.
    <li>Many fixes to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmctl.8">vmctl(8)</a>
        and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> error handling.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>IEEE 802.11 wireless stack improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>MiRA 802.11n TX rate scaling now supports devices with unequal numbers
        of Tx and Rx streams. Fixes 11n mode for some
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/athn.8">athn(8)</a> devices.
    <li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwn.8">iwn(8)</a> and
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.8">iwm(8)</a> drivers will now start
        scanning for a new access point if they no longer receive beacons from
        the current AP.
    <li>Prefer the 5GHz band over the 2GHz band during access point selection.
    <li>Improved debug output in
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dmesg.8">dmesg(8)</a> when a wireless
        interface is put into debug mode with
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Generic network stack improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>Incoming and forwarded IP packets are now processed without
        KERNEL_LOCK, resulting in better performances and reduced latency.
    <li>The kernel no longer handles IPv6 Stateless Address
        Autoconfiguration (RFC 4862), allowing cleanup and simplification
        of the IPv6 network stack.
    <li>The kernel sends IPv6 router solicitations for link local addresses
        with a link local source address.
    <li>FQ-CoDel algorithm has been implemented for use with <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf#QUEUEING">pf(4) queueing</a>.
    <li>Improved IPv6 checks for IPsec policies and made them consistent
	with IPv4.
    <li>Refactored local IP delivery to process IPsec packets in a flow and
        avoid enqueueing a second time.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a>
	now inspects AH packets and matches on the inner protocol.
	This makes IPv4 authentication headers work like IPv6.
    <li>The length of extension header chains in pf(4) is limited.
	This prevents spending excessive CPU time on crafted packets.
    <li>Block IPv6 packets in
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a>
        that have a hop-by-hop options header or a destination options header.
	Such packets can be passed by adding "allow-opts" to the rule.
        This makes IPv6 option handling consistent with IPv4.
    <li>If the IPv4 ID gets reused too fast, pf(4) fragment reassembly
	uses a smarter strategy to drop packets.
    <li>Enabled the use of per-CPU caches in the network packet allocators.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Installer improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>The installer now uses the Allotment Routing Table (ART).
    <li>A unique kernel is now created by the installer to boot from after
        install/upgrade.
    <li>On release installs of architectures supported by syspatch,
        "syspatch -c" is now added to rc.firsttime.
    <li>Backwards compatibility code to support the 'rtsol' keyword in
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if.5">hostname.if(5)</a>
        has been removed.
    <li>The <tt>install.site</tt> and <tt>upgrade.site</tt> scripts are now
        executed at the end of the install/upgrade process.
    <li>More detailed information is shown to identify disks.
    <li>The IPv6 default router selection has been fixed.
    <li>On the amd64 platform, AES-NI is used if present.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>A new daemon, <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/slaacd.8">slaacd(8)</a> handles IPv6
        Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (RFC 4862).
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rtadvd.8">rtadvd(8)</a> now supports
        "Reducing Energy Consumption of Router Advertisements" (RFC 7772).
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rtadvd.8">rtadvd(8)</a> has
        been fixed to quickly handle IPv6 prefix changes on the system.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsecctl.8">ipsecctl(8)</a>
	can now show SA bundles and the "bundle" keyword allows them to be
        explicitly created. This avoids confusion as they were previously
        used implicitly.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a>
        now has a <tt>-W recvlimit</tt> option to terminate netcat after
        receiving the specified number of packets. This allows for a UDP
        request to be sent, a reply to be received and the result checked on
        the command line.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a>
        now has a <tt>-Z</tt> option, allowing the peer certificate and chain to be
        saved to a file in PEM format.
    <li>A new <tt>-T tlscompat</tt> option was added to
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a>, which enables the use
        of all TLS protocols and libtls "compat" ciphers.
    <li>Various races have been fixed in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>,
	expecially in HTTP chunked mode.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ndp.8">ndp(8)</a> now shows the
        relevant NDP information when run in a non-default routing
        domain.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifstated.8">ifstated(8)</a> now
        copes with interface departures/arrivals.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a> can now
        be started multiple times in different
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rdomain.4">routing domains</a>,
        this provides virtual router functionality.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Security improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>A new function
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/freezero.3">freezero(3)</a>
	to easily clear and free memory holding sensitive data has been added.
    <li>Double free detection has been improved when the F
    	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a> option is used.
    	The existing S option now includes F.
    <li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tty.4#TIOCSTI">TIOCSTI</a>
	tty ioctl has been removed.  The I/O-loops in the last two consumers
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/csh.1">csh(1)</a> and
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mail.1">mail(1)</a>
	were rewritten to cope with the removal.
    <li>Trapsleds, a new mitigation that significantly reduces the amount of
        nops in the instruction stream, replacing them with trap instructions
        or jump-over-trap sequences, thereby requiring greater accuracy for
        targetting potential gadgets.
    <li>Kernel Address Randomized Link (KARL), a new "link-kit" allows the .o
        files of the kernel to be relinked in a random order, creating a unique
        kernel for each boot.  /bsd is now non-readable to users, to try to
        keep the secret.
    <li>Like with libc previously,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a> re-links libcrypto on
        startup, placing the objects in a random order.
    <li>In addition to libcrypto, to deter code reuse exploits,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a> re-links
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so.1">ld.so</a> on
        startup, placing the objects in a random order.
    <li>If process accounting is activated with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/accton.8">accton(8)</a>,
	the daily mail shows pledge violations and program crashes.
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lastcomm.1">lastcomm(1)</a>
	uses the flags P and T for such processes.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pflogd.8">pflogd(8)</a> uses the
	fork+exec model.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump.8">tcpdump(8)</a> uses the
	fork+exec model.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifstated.8">ifstated(8)</a>
      uses <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a>.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpd(8)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpctl.8">snmpctl(8)</a> now use
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a>.
    <li>Tighter pledge for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/at.1">at(1)</a>.
    <li>Fixed and simplified pledge logic for
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a>.
    <li>More application of recallocarray(3) in userland, and tracked sizes
        to free(9) in the kernel.
    <li>Achieve higher levels of paranoia regarding structure packing, and
        clear many kernel objects before passing to userland.
    <li>Disable some optimizations in clang(1) due to incompatibility
        with security.
    <li>For instance, cope with clang(1)'s assumption that static or const
        objects placed in unknown sections (such as .openbsd.randomdata)
        are surely always 0, and therefore such memory accesses can be
        optimized away.
    <li>In kernel, randomly bias down the top-of-stack per kthread.
    </ul>
<p>

<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.8">dhcpd(8)</a>/
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay.8">dhcrelay(8)</a> improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>Add support for echo-client-id statement to
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.conf.5">dhclient.conf(5)</a>.
    <li>Take greater care to process all data read, and only data read, from the
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bpf.4">bpf(4)</a>
      socket.
    <li>Use /dev/bpf instead of /dev/bpf0.
    <li>Handle DHCPINFORM messages from clients behind a DHCP relay.
    <li>Fix handling of
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/carp.4">carp(4)</a>
      interfaces in
       <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay.8">dhcrelay(8)</a>.
    <li>Don't stop
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay.8">dhcrelay(8)</a>
      logging to stderr when it is started with the -d option.
    </ul>
<p>
    
<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a> improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>Log messages reworked and clarified, in particular by prefixing
	the name of the relevant network interface.
    <li>Treat SSID as 0 to 32 bytes of binary data, not a string.
    <li>Use RTM_PROPOSAL to take control of an interface rather than flipping
      interface down and up in the hope that other
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a>
      instances notice.
    <li>Reduce file operations needed by -L option by opening file at
      startup and using it throughout process lifetime.
    <li>Improve <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolv.conf.5">resolv.conf(5)</a>
      handling by reducing writes and more reliably determining which interface
      has the current default route.
    <li>Take greater care to process all data read, and only data read, from the
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bpf.4">bpf(4)</a>
      socket.
    <li>Improve the determination of the link state of an interface.
    <li>Decline inappropriate lease offers as soon as they are deemed
      inappropriate.
    <li>Drop support for the timestamp formats used in lease files created

    </ul>
<p>

<li>Assorted improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/i386.html">i386</a> and
        <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html">amd64</a>
        platforms have switched to using
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang-local.1">clang(1)</a>
        as the base system compiler.
    <li>Improved UTF-8 line editing support for
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a>
	Emacs and Vi input mode.
    <li>The HISTFILE of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a> now uses
        a plain text format. Support for the
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh#HISTCONTROL">HISTCONTROL</a>
        environment variable was added.
    <li>The performance of the memory deallocator used by
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a> has been fixed.
    <li>The <tt>emacs-usemeta</tt> <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a>
      flag is no longer needed and is now deprecated.
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/futex">futex(2)</a> syscall.
    <li>New pthread
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pthread_mutex_init">mutex</a> and
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pthread_cond_init">condition
        variable</a> implementations improving latency
        of threaded applications.
    <li>New POSIX <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/newlocale.3">xlocale</a>
        implementation written from scratch, complete in the sense that
        all POSIX *locale(3) and *_l(3) functions are included, but in
        OpenBSD, we of course only really care about <code>LC_CTYPE</code>
        and we only support ASCII and UTF-8.
    <li>Automatic hibernation and suspend by
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/apmd">apmd</a>
        when battery is low.
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ctfdump">ctfdump(1)</a> and
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ctfconv">ctfconv(1)</a>
        tools to manipulate CTF (Compact C Type Format).
    <li>The error handling in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/syslogd.8">syslogd(8)</a>
	has been improved.
	Even if internal errors occur, the daemon tries to keep
	unaffected subsystems active.
	So as many messages as possible are logged.
	They can be filtered by severity and facility "syslog".
    <li>syslogd(8) can now suppress "last message repeated" which is
	useful for remote logging.
    <li>syslogd(8) can listen on multiple TLS sockets.
    <li>syslogd(8) closes the *.514 UDP sockets when they are not
	needed.
    <li>Truncate log messages at 8192 bytes everywhere.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/newsyslog.8">newsyslog(8)</a>
      now skips and logs invalid config lines.
    <li>Nested mount points are umounted in correct order.
    <li>Fix creation of
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
      CONCAT volumes.
    <li>Include
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
      volume and backing disk information in i/o error messages.
    <li>Make
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vioscsi.4">vioscsi(4)</a>
      a normal
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scsi.4">scsi(4)</a>
      device by eliminating its use of the obsolete XS_NO_CCB mechanism.
    <li>Remove last vestiges of now unused XS_NO_CCB mechanism.
    <li>Userspace can now get the address of the thread control block
        without a system call on OCTEON II and later.
    <li>FPU is enabled on OCTEON III.
    <li>GENERIC kernels now include a .SUNW_ctf section containing CTF data.
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> <tt>kill</tt>
    command, send an uncatchable SIGABRT to a process.
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> <tt>pprint</tt>
    command, using CTF information to "pretty print" global symbols.
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a>
    <tt>show struct</tt> command, using CTF information to display the content
    of in memory C structures.
    <li>x86: <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> uses CTF data
    to display the correct number of function arguments in backtraces.
    <li>Power off all codecs in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/azalia.4">azalia(4)</a> to avoid static
      noise in speakers and headphones on reboot.
    <li>Fix i386 boot regression seen on very old 486DX CPUs. 
    <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/witness.4">witness(4)</a> tool
        for debugging lock order issues in the kernel.
        The tool is not built in by default, and only amd64, hppa and i386
        are supported.
    <li>Modernize some bizzare tty behaviours of getty(8).
    <li>Some subtle changes to pledge(2) to satisfy requirements observed
        in real life. 
    <li>Prefer use of waitpid(2) rather than wait(3) where possible, to
        avoid problems with pre-existing children.
    <li>Rewrite swaths of machine-dependent system call stub code in ld.so(1)
        in a more portable fashion.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pool_cache_init.9">Per-CPU
        caches</a> implemented in pools.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pthread_mutex_lock.3">Mutex</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pthread_cond_wait.3">condition-variable</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pthread_getspecific.3">thread-specific data</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pthread_once.3">pthread_once(3)</a>,
	and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pthread_exit.3">pthread_exit(3)</a>
	routines moved to libc from libpthread for ease of library
	use and compatibility with other OSes.
    <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openpty.3">getptmfd(3)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openpty.3">fdopenpty(3)</a>, and
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openpty.3">fdforkpty(3)</a>
	to simplify privilege separation and use of pledge(2).
    <li>Improved computational complexity in various cases of
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/strstr.3">strstr(3)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/qsort.3">qsort(3)</a>,
	and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/glob.3">glob(3)</a>.
    <li>Added support for <tt>EV_RECEIPT</tt> and <tt>EV_DISPATCH</tt> to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kqueue.2">kqueue(2)</a>.
    <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ktrace.2">fktrace(2)</a>.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>OpenSMTPD 6.0.0
    <ul>
    <li>Fix an off-by-one in the config parser that made 65535 an invalid port.
    <li>Fix a fd leak in the session congestion mechanism.
    <li>Fix a possible crash when relaying with smtps.
    <li>Remove support for the "listen secure" syntax (expicitely define two listeners for tls and smtps instead).
    <li>Remove experimental support for filters.
    <li>Assorted code and documentation cleanups and improvements.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>OpenSSH 7.6
    <ul>
    <li>Security:
      <ul>
      <li>sftp-server(8): in read-only mode, sftp-server was incorrectly
          permitting creation of zero-length files.
      </ul>
    <li>New/changed features:
      <ul>
      <li>Add RemoteCommand option to specify a command in the
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>
	config file instead of giving it on the client's command
	line.
	The feature allows to automate tasks using ssh config.
      <li>sshd(8): add ExposeAuthInfo option that enables writing details of
          the authentication methods used (including public keys where
          applicable) to a file that is exposed via a $SSH_USER_AUTH
          environment variable in the subsequent session.
      <li>ssh(1): add support for reverse dynamic forwarding. In this mode,
          ssh will act as a SOCKS4/5 proxy and forward connections
          to destinations requested by the remote SOCKS client. This mode
          is requested using extended syntax for the -R and RemoteForward
          options and, because it is implemented solely at the client,
          does not require the server be updated to be supported.
      <li>sshd(8): allow LogLevel directive in sshd_config Match blocks.
      <li>ssh-keygen(1): allow inclusion of arbitrary string or flag
          certificate extensions and critical options.
      <li>ssh-keygen(1): allow ssh-keygen to use a key held in ssh-agent as
          a CA when signing certificates.
      <li>ssh(1)/sshd(8): allow IPQoS=none in ssh/sshd to not set an explicit
          ToS/DSCP value and just use the operating system default.
      <li>ssh-add(1): added -q option to make ssh-add quiet on success.
      <li>ssh(1): expand the StrictHostKeyChecking option with two new
          settings. The first "accept-new" will automatically accept
          hitherto-unseen keys but will refuse connections for changed or
          invalid hostkeys. This is a safer subset of the current behaviour
          of StrictHostKeyChecking=no. The second setting "off", is a synonym
          for the current behaviour of StrictHostKeyChecking=no: accept new
          host keys, and continue connection for hosts with incorrect
          hostkeys. A future release will change the meaning of
          StrictHostKeyChecking=no to the behaviour of "accept-new".
      <li>ssh(1): add SyslogFacility option to ssh(1) matching the equivalent
          option in sshd(8).
      </ul>
    <li>The following significant bugs have been fixed in this release:
      <ul>
      <li>ssh(1): use HostKeyAlias if specified instead of hostname for
          matching host certificate principal names.
      <li>sftp(1): implement sorting for globbed ls.
      <li>ssh(1): add a user@host prefix to client's "Permission denied"
          messages, useful in particular when using "stacked" connections
          (e.g. ssh -J) where it's not clear which host is denying.
      <li>ssh(1): accept unknown EXT_INFO extension values that contain \0
          characters. These are legal, but would previously cause fatal
          connection errors if received.
      <li>ssh(1)/sshd(8): repair compression statistics printed at
          connection exit.
      <li>sftp(1): print '?' instead of incorrect link count (that the
          protocol doesn't provide) for remote listings.
      <li>ssh(1): return failure rather than fatal() for more cases during
          session multiplexing negotiations. Causes the session to fall back
          to a non-mux connection if they occur.
      <li>ssh(1): mention that the server may send debug messages to explain
          public key authentication problems under some circumstances.
      <li>Translate OpenSSL error codes to better report incorrect passphrase
          errors when loading private keys.
      <li>sshd(8): adjust compatibility patterns for WinSCP to correctly
          identify versions that implement only the legacy DH group exchange
          scheme.
      <li>ssh(1): print the "Killed by signal 1" message only at LogLevel
          verbose so that it is not shown at the default level; prevents it
          from appearing during ssh -J and equivalent ProxyCommand configs.
      <li>ssh-keygen(1): when generating all hostkeys (ssh-keygen -A), clobber
          existing keys if they exist but are zero length. zero-length keys
          could previously be made if ssh-keygen failed or was interrupted part
          way through generating them.
      <li>ssh(1): fix pledge(2) violation in the escape sequence "~&" used to
          place the current session in the background.
      <li>ssh-keyscan(1): avoid double-close() on file descriptors.
      <li>sshd(8): avoid reliance on shared use of pointers shared between
          monitor and child sshd processes.
      <li>sshd_config(8): document available AuthenticationMethods.
      <li>ssh(1): avoid truncation in some login prompts.
      <li>ssh(1): make "--" before the hostname terminate argument processing
          after the hostname too.
      <li>ssh-keygen(1): switch from aes256-cbc to aes256-ctr for encrypting
          new-style private keys. Fixes problems related to private key
          handling for no-OpenSSL builds.
      <li>ssh(1): warn and do not attempt to use keys when the public and
          private halves do not match. 
      <li>sftp(1): don't print verbose error message when ssh disconnects
          from under sftp.
      <li>sshd(8): fix keepalive scheduling problem: activity on a forwarded
          port from preventing the keepalive from being sent.
      <li>sshd(8): when started without root privileges, don't require the
          privilege separation user or path to exist. Makes running the
          regression tests easier without touching the filesystem.
      <li>Make integrity.sh regression tests more robust against timeouts.
      <li>ssh(1)/sshd(8): correctness fix for channels implementation: accept
          channel IDs greater than 0x7FFFFFFF.
      </ul>
    </ul>
<p>

<li>LibreSSL 2.6.3
    <ul>
    <li>Added support for providing CRLs to libtls - once a CRL is provided via
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_config_set_crl_file.3">tls_config_set_crl_file(3)</a>
        or
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_config_set_crl_mem.3">tls_config_set_crl_mem(3)</a>,
        CRL checking is enabled and required for the full certificate chain.
    <li>Reworked TLS certificate name verification code to more strictly
        follow RFC 6125.
    <li>Cleaned up and simplified server key exchange EC point handling.
    <li>Removed inconsistent IPv6 handling from BIO_get_accept_socket(),
        simplified BIO_get_host_ip() and BIO_accept().
    <li>Added definitions for three OIDs used in EV certificates.
    <li>Relaxed SNI validation to allow non-RFC-compliant clients using literal
        IP addresses with SNI to connect to a libtls-based TLS server.
    <li>Added tls_peer_cert_chain_pem() to libtls, useful in private certificate
        validation callbacks such as those in relayd.
    <li>Converted explicit clear/free sequences to use
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/freezero.3">freezero(3)</a>.
    <li>Fixed the
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1">openssl(1)</a>
        ca command so that it generates certificates with RFC 5280-conformant time.
    <li>Added
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_TIME_set_tm.3">ASN1_TIME_set_tm(3)</a>
        to set an ASN.1 time from a struct tm *.
    <li>Added
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version.3">SSL{,_CTX}_set_{min,max}_proto_version(3)</a>
        functions.
    <li>Imported HKDF (HMAC Key Derivation Function) from BoringSSL.
    <li>Provided a
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_unload_file.3">tls_unload_file(3)</a>
        function that frees the memory returned from a
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_load_file.3">tls_load_file(3)</a>
        call, ensuring that the contents become inaccessible.
    <li>Implemented reference counting for libtls tls_config, allowing
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_config_free.3">tls_config_free(3)</a>
        to be called as soon as it has been passed to the final
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_configure.3">tls_configure(3)</a>
        call, simplifying lifetime tracking for the application.
    <li>Dropped cipher suites using DSS authentication.
    <li>Removed support for DSS/DSA from libssl.
    <li>Distinguish between self-issued certificates and self-signed
        certificates. The certificate verification code has special cases
        for self-signed certificates and without this change, self-issued
        certificates (which it seems are common place with
        openvpn/easyrsa) were also being included in this category.
    <li>Added a new TLS extension handling framework and converted all
        TLS extensions to use it.
    <li>Improved and added many new manpages. Updated
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_CTX_check_private_key.3">SSL_{CTX_,}check_private_key(3)</a>
        manpages with additional cautions regarding their use.
    <li>Cleaned up and simplified EC key/curve configuration handling.
    <li>Added
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_config_set_ecdhecurves.3">tls_config_set_ecdhecurves(3)</a>
        to libtls, which allows the names of the elliptical curves that may
        be used during client and server key exchange to be specified.
    <li>Converted more code paths to use CBB/CBS.
    <li>Removed NPN support - NPN was never standardised and the last draft
        expired in October 2012.
    <li>Removed SSL_OP_CRYPTOPRO_TLSEXT_BUG workaround for old/broken
        CryptoPro clients.
    <li>Removed support for the TLS padding extension, which was added as a
        workaround for an old bug in F5's TLS termination.
    <li>Added ability to clamp notafter values in certificates for systems
        with 32-bit time_t. This is necessary to conform to RFC 5280 4.1.2.5.
    <li>Removed the original (pre-IETF) chacha20-poly1305 cipher suites.
    <li>Reclassified ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA from HIGH to MEDIUM.
    <li>Provide a useful error with libtls if there are no OCSP URLs in a
        peer certificate.
    <li>Keep track of which keypair is in use by a TLS context, fixing a bug
        where a TLS server with SNI would only return the OCSP staple for the
        default keypair.
    <li>If
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_config_parse_protocols.3">tls_config_parse_protocols(3)</a>
        is called with a NULL pointer it now
        returns the default protocols.

    <li>Full <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mandocdb.5">mandoc.db(5)</a>
      databases are now enabled by default, allowing semantic searching
      with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/apropos.1">apropos(1)</a>
      without any local configuration changes.
    <li>Full integration of the former
      <a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/regress/usr.bin/mdoclint/">mdoclint(1)</a>
      utility into <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.1">mandoc(1)</a>
      <code>-Wall</code>, new <code>-Wstyle</code> and

      use one common data type and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ohash_init.3">ohash_init(3)</a>
      for all requests and macros and support creation of syntax tree
      nodes in the roff(7) parser, allowing support for many new
      low-level roff(7) features.
      Only about 25 ports still need <code>USE_GROFF</code> now.
    <li>Many improvements to
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tbl.7">tbl(7)</a>
      parsing and formatting,
      including automatic line wrapping inside table columns.
    <li>Many improvements to

<h3 id="upgrade"><font color="#0000e0">How to upgrade</font></h3>

If you already have an OpenBSD 6.1 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade62.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
<p>

<hr>

<h3 id="sourcecode"><font color="#0000e0">Notes about the source code</font></h3>

<tt>src.tar.gz</tt> contains a source archive starting at <tt>/usr/src</tt>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mkdir -p /usr/src</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<tt>sys.tar.gz</tt> contains a source archive starting at <tt>/usr/src/sys</tt>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
<p>

<hr>

<h3 id="ports"><font color="#0000e0">Ports Tree</font></h3>

A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the <i>-stable</i> branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/ports</b>
# <b>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_6_2</b>
</pre></blockquote>

[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 6.2 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
