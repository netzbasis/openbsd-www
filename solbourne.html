<p>
OpenBSD/solbourne is an experimental port of OpenBSD to the Solbourne "IDT"
family of workstations, built upon the SPARC-compatible Panasonic <i>KAP</i>
processor.
</table>

<hr>

<h3 id="history"><strong>History:</strong></h3>

<p>
The KAP processor used in the IDT systems, albeit using an instruction
set similar to the SPARC processors, uses a completely different MMU.
Because of this, no free operating system considered running on these Solbourne
machines more than a few minutes...

<p>
At some point, an S4000 was donated by Mike Nicewonger to Miod Vallat, who then
had no excuse not to work on a port.
After a few years of procrastination, real work on a port eventually started in
march 2005, leading to an initial import in the OpenBSD tree exactly one month
later. And work continues...

<hr>

<h3 id="status"><strong>Current status:</strong></h3>

<p>
Currently, only the S4000 system has been tested; but other systems should work,
although the L2 cache in the S4000DX systems is not supported yet.

<p>
Right now, the system boots single-user, but userland has issues, which are
being worked on.
