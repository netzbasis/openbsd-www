<hr>

<p>
OpenBSD/amd64 runs on AMD's Athlon-64 family of processors in 64-bit mode.
It also runs on processors made by other manufacturers which have cloned
the AMD64 extensions.  (Some Intel processors lack support for important
PAE NX bit, which means those machines will run without any W^X support --
it is thus safer to run those machines in i386 mode).
<p>
Note that <a href="i386.html">OpenBSD/i386</a> also runs on these
processors, but in 32-bit mode.

<p>
X Window System support is available for most graphics cards, using
the X.Org server.  As with other free operating systems it is highly recommended
that Nvidia cards are avoided since this vendor continues to show tremendous
resistance towards releasing information that would allow X.Org to support their
hardware properly.

<h3 id="status"><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Current status:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The only major shortcoming at this time is that the kernel debugger
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ddb&amp;arch=amd64&amp;sektion=4">ddb</a>
is somewhat poor.

<hr>

<h3 id="hardware"><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Supported hardware:</strong></font></h3>

<h4>Processors</h4>

<p>
All versions of the AMD Athlon 64 processors and their clones are
supported.

<h4>SMP support</h4>

<p>
Starting with OpenBSD 3.6, OpenBSD/amd64 supports most SMP
(Symmetrical MultiProcessor) systems.
To support SMP operation, a separate SMP kernel (<tt>bsd.mp</tt>) is
included with the installation file sets.

<h3><font color="#0000e0">Unsupported Hardware:</font></h3>

<p>
New hardware is constantly being released, some of which may lack support. 
Your <a href="donations.html">donation of time, hardware, or documentation</a>
can accelerate this support!

<p>
The latest supported OpenBSD/amd64 release is
<a href="57.html">OpenBSD 5.7</a>.
Here are the
<a href="http://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/5.7/amd64/INSTALL.amd64">
OpenBSD/amd64 5.7 installation instructions
</a>.

<p>
Snapshots are made available from time to time, in
<a href="http://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/amd64">this location</a>
as well as in a few
<a href="ftp.html">mirrors</a>.
Here are the
<a href="http://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/amd64/INSTALL.amd64">
OpenBSD/amd64 snapshot installation instructions
</a> as well.

<p>
There are several installation media provided:
<ul>
  <li><strong>CD boot</strong>
  <br>
  The CD provides an <i>El Torito</i> no-emulation boot image
  that includes almost all OpenBSD drivers.
  This also includes minimal USB support (storage devices and keyboard).<br>
  For the latest list of drivers available on this image, take a look at the
  <a href="http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/arch/amd64/conf/RAMDISK_CD?rev=HEAD">RAMDISK_CD</a>
  kernel configuration file.
  <li><strong>Floppy A</strong> (floppy56.fs)
  <br>
  This 1.44MB floppy image contains the most common drivers.
  It is designed to cover the most typical PC. As a general rule, you will
  find that the missing drivers are ones which need large microcodes to run,
  such as for rare SCSI cards, gigabit ethernet cards, or RAID devices.<br>
