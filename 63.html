    <li>Support for configuring the Don't Fragment flag packets encapsulated
        by tunnel interfaces.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Installer improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>if install.site or upgrade.site fails, notify the user and error out
      after storing rand.seed.
    <li>allow CIDR notation when entering IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
    <li>repair selection of a HTTP mirror from the list of mirrors.

      long as no hostname is known.
    <li>correctly detect which interface has the default route and if it was
      configured via DHCP.
    <li>ensure sets can be read from the prefetch area.
    <li>ensure URL redirection is effective for entire install/upgrade.
    <li>add the HTTP proxy used when fetching sets to rc.firsttime, where

    <li>ensure that IPv6 is configured for dynamically created network
      interfaces like <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vlan.4">vlan(4)</a>.
    <li>create correct hostname when both domain-name and
      domain-search options are provided in the DHCP lease.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpctl.8">bgpctl(8)</a> has a new
        <b>ssv</b> option which outputs rib entries as a single semicolon-separated
        like for selection before output.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/slaacd.8">slaacd(8)</a> generates
        random but stable IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration addresses according
        to RFC 7217.
        These are enabled per default in accordance with RFC 8064.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/slaacd.8">slaacd(8)</a> follows
        RFC 4862 by removing an artificial limitation on /64 sized prefixes
        using RFC 7217 (random but stable) and RFC 4941 (privacy) style
        stateless autoconfiguration addresses.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ospfd.8">ospfd(8)</a> can now set the
        metric for a route depending on the status of an interface.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a> has a new
        <b>staticarp</b> option to make interfaces reply to ARP requests only.

    <ul>
    <li>Use even more trap-sleds on various architectures.
    <li>More use of .rodata for constant variables in assembly source.
    <li>Stop using x86 "repz ret" in dusty corners of the tree.
    <li>Introduce "execpromises" in
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a>.
    <li>The elfrdsetroot utility used to build ramdisks and the
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rebound">rebound(8)</a>
        monitoring process now use
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a>.
    <li>Prepare for the introduction of <b>MAP_STACK</b> to
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a> after 6.3.
    <li>Push a small piece of KARL-linked kernel text into the random
        number generator as entropy at startup.
    <li>Put a small random gap at the top of thread stacks, so that attackers
        have yet another calculation to perform for their ROP work.
    <li>Mitigation for Meltdown vulnerability for Intel brand amd64 CPUs.
    <li>OpenBSD/arm64 now uses kernel page table isolation to mitigate
        Spectre variant 3 (Meltdown) attacks.
    <li>OpenBSD/armv7 and OpenBSD/arm64 now flush the Branch Target Buffer
        (BTB) on processors that do speculative execution to
        mitigate Spectre variant 2 attacks.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pool_get.9">pool_get(9)</a> perturbs
        the order of items on newly allocated pages, making the kernel heap
        layout harder to predict.
    <li>The
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.2/ktrace.2">fktrace(2)</a>
        system call was deleted.
    </ul>
<p>

<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a> improvements:
    <ul>
      <li>Parsing <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">
	dhclient.conf(5)</a> no longer leaks SSID strings, strings that are
	too long for the parsing buffer or repeated string options and commands.
      <li>Storing leases in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">
	  dhclient.conf(5)</a> is no longer supported.
      <li>'DENY' is no longer valid in  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">
	  dhclient.conf(5)</a>.
      <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">
	  dhclient.conf(5)</a> and
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.leases.5">
	  dhclient.leases(5)</a>
	parsing error messages have been simplified and clarified, with
	improved behaviour in the presence of unexpected semicolons.
      <li>More care is taken to only use configuration information that was
	successfully parsed.
      <li>'-n' has been added, which causes
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">
	  dhclient(8)</a> to exit after parsing
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">
	  dhclient.conf(5)</a>.
      <li>Default routes in options classless-static-routes (121) and
	classless-ms-static-routes (249) are now correctly represented in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.leases.5">
	  dhclient.leases(5)</a> files.
    <li>Overwrite the file specified with '-L' rather than appending to it.
    <li>Leases in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.leases.5">
	dhclient.leases(5)</a> now contain an 'epoch' attribute recording
      the time the lease was accepted, which is used to calculate correct
      renewal, rebinding and expiry times.
    <li>No longer nag about underscores in names violating RFC 952.
    <li>Unconditionally send host-name information when
      requesting a lease, eliminating the need for
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">
	  dhclient.conf(5)</a> in the default installation.
    <li>Be quiet by default. '-q' has been removed and '-v' added to
      enable verbose logging.
    <li>Decline duplicate offers for the requested address.
    <li>Unconditionally go into the background after link-timeout seconds.
    <li>Significantly reduce logging when being quiet, but make '-v' log
      all debug information without needing to compile a custom executable.
    <li>Ignore 'interface' statements in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.leases.5">
	  dhclient.leases(5)</a> and assume all leases in the file are
	for the interface being configured.
    <li>Display the source of the lease bound to the interface.
    <li>'ignore', 'request' and 'require' declarations in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">
	  dhclient.conf(5)</a> now add the specified options to the relevant
	list rather than replacing the list.
    <li>Eliminate a startup race that could result in
      	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">
	  dhclient(8)</a> exiting without configuring the interface.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Assorted improvements:
    <ul>
    <li>Code reorganization and other improvements to
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>
	and friends to make them more efficient.
    <li>When performing suspend or hibernate operations, ensure all filesystems
        are properly synchronized and marked clean, or if they cannot be
        put into perfectly clean state on disk (due to open+unlinked files)
        then mark them dirty, so that a failed resume/unhibernate is guaranteed
	to perform <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fsck.8">fsck(8)</a>.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a>
        autodetects the agreement URL and follows 30x HTTP redirects.
    <li>Added __cxa_thread_atexit() to support modern C++ tool chains.

      validity of MBR partition offsets entered while editing.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> now ensures that
      default values lie within the valid range.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/less.1">less(1)</a> now splits only
      the environment variable LESS on '$'.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/less.1">less(1)</a> no longer creates
      a spurious file when encountering '$' in the initial command.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a> now validates
      the number of chunks when assembling a volume, ensuring the on-disk
      and in-memory metadata are in sync.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a> now
      always offers to edit an FFS partition's fragment size before offering to
      edit the blocksize.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a> now
      allows editing the cylinders/group (cpg) attribute whenever the partition
      blocksize can be edited.

    <li>Assorted cleanups and improvements.
    <li>Numerous manual page fixes and improvements.
    </ul>
<p>

<li>OpenSSH 7.7
    <ul>
    <li>New/changed features:
      <ul>
      <li>All: Add experimental support for PQC XMSS keys (Extended Hash-
          Based Signatures) based on the algorithm described in
          https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-xmss-hash-based-signatures-12
          The XMSS signature code is experimental and not compiled in by
          default.
      <li>sshd(8): Add a "rdomain" criteria for the sshd_config Match keyword
          to allow conditional configuration that depends on which routing
          domain a connection was received on (currently supported on OpenBSD
          and Linux).
      <li>sshd_config(5): Add an optional rdomain qualifier to the
          ListenAddress directive to allow listening on different routing
          domains. This is supported only on OpenBSD and Linux at present.
      <li>sshd_config(5): Add RDomain directive to allow the authenticated
          session to be placed in an explicit routing domain. This is only
          supported on OpenBSD at present.
      <li>sshd(8): Add "expiry-time" option for authorized_keys files to
          allow for expiring keys.
      <li>ssh(1): Add a BindInterface option to allow binding the outgoing
          connection to an interface's address (basically a more usable
          BindAddress).
      <li>ssh(1): Expose device allocated for tun/tap forwarding via a new
          %T expansion for LocalCommand. This allows LocalCommand to be used
          to prepare the interface.
      <li>sshd(8): Expose the device allocated for tun/tap forwarding via a
          new SSH_TUNNEL environment variable. This allows automatic setup of
          the interface and surrounding network configuration automatically on
          the server.
      <li>ssh(1)/scp(1)/sftp(1): Add URI support to ssh, sftp and scp, e.g.
          ssh://user@host or sftp://user@host/path.  Additional connection
          parameters described in draft-ietf-secsh-scp-sftp-ssh-uri-04 are not
          implemented since the ssh fingerprint format in the draft uses the
          deprecated MD5 hash with no way to specify the any other algorithm.
      <li>ssh-keygen(1): Allow certificate validity intervals that specify
          only a start or stop time (instead of both or neither).
      <li>sftp(1): Allow "cd" and "lcd" commands with no explicit path
          argument. lcd will change to the local user's home directory as
          usual. cd will change to the starting directory for session (because
          the protocol offers no way to obtain the remote user's home
          directory). bz#2760
      <li>sshd(8): When doing a config test with sshd -T, only require the
          attributes that are actually used in Match criteria rather than (an
          incomplete list of) all criteria.
      </ul>
    <li>The following significant bugs have been fixed in this release:
      <ul>
      <li>ssh(1)/sshd(8): More strictly check signature types during key
          exchange against what was negotiated. Prevents downgrade of RSA
          signatures made with SHA-256/512 to SHA-1.
      <li>sshd(8): Fix support for client that advertise a protocol version
          of "1.99" (indicating that they are prepared to accept both SSHv1 and
          SSHv2). This was broken in OpenSSH 7.6 during the removal of SSHv1
          support. bz#2810
      <li>ssh(1): Warn when the agent returns a ssh-rsa (SHA1) signature when
          a rsa-sha2-256/512 signature was requested. This condition is possible
          when an old or non-OpenSSH agent is in use. bz#2799
      <li>ssh-agent(1): Fix regression introduce in 7.6 that caused ssh-agent
          to fatally exit if presented an invalid signature request message.
      <li>sshd_config(5): Accept yes/no flag options case-insensitively, as
          has been the case in ssh_config(5) for a long time. bz#2664
      <li>ssh(1): Improve error reporting for failures during connection.
          Under some circumstances misleading errors were being shows. bz#2814
      <li>ssh-keyscan(1): Add -D option to allow printing of results directly
          in SSHFP format. bz#2821
      <li>regress tests: fix PuTTY interop test broken in last release's SSHv1
          removal. bz#2823
      <li>ssh(1): Compatibility fix for some servers that erroneously drop the
          connection when the IUTF8 (RFC8160) option is sent.
      <li>scp(1): Disable RemoteCommand and RequestTTY in the ssh session
          started by scp (sftp was already doing this.)
      <li>ssh-keygen(1): Refuse to create a certificate with an unusable
          number of principals.
      <li>ssh-keygen(1): Fatally exit if ssh-keygen is unable to write all the
          public key during key generation. Previously it would silently
          ignore errors writing the comment and terminating newline.
      <li>ssh(1): Do not modify hostname arguments that are addresses by
          automatically forcing them to lower-case. Instead canonicalise them
          to resolve ambiguities (e.g. ::0001 => ::1) before they are matched
          against known_hosts. bz#2763
      <li>ssh(1): Don't accept junk after "yes" or "no" responses to hostkey
          prompts. bz#2803
      <li>sftp(1): Have sftp print a warning about shell cleanliness when
          decoding the first packet fails, which is usually caused by shells
          polluting stdout of non-interactive startups. bz#2800
      <li>ssh(1)/sshd(8): Switch timers in packet code from using wall-clock
          time to monotonic time, allowing the packet layer to better function
          over a clock step and avoiding possible integer overflows during
          steps.
      <li>Numerous manual page fixes and improvements.
      </ul>
    </ul>
<p>

<li>LibreSSL 2.7.2
   <ul>
   <li> Added support for many OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1 APIs, based on
   observations of real-world usage in applications. These are
   implemented in parallel with existing OpenSSL 1.0.1 APIs - visibility
   changes have not been made to existing structs, allowing code written
   for older OpenSSL APIs to continue working.
   <li> Extensive corrections, improvements, and additions to the
   API documentation, including new public APIs from OpenSSL that had
   no pre-existing documentation.
   <li> Added support for automatic library initialization in libcrypto,
   libssl, and libtls. Support for pthread_once or a compatible
   equivalent is now required of the target operating system. As a
   side-effect, minimum Windows support is Vista or higher.
   <li> Converted more packet handling methods to CBB, which improves
   resiliency when generating TLS messages.
   <li> Completed TLS extension handling rewrite, improving consistency of
   checks for malformed and duplicate extensions.
   <li>Rewrote ASN1_TYPE_{get,set}_octetstring() using templated ASN.1.
   This removes the last remaining use of the old M_ASN1_* macros
   (asn1_mac.h) from API that needs to continue to exist.
   <li> Added support for client-side session resumption in libtls.
   A libtls client can specify a session file descriptor (a regular
   file with appropriate ownership and permissions) and libtls will
   manage reading and writing of session data across TLS handshakes.
   <li> Improved support for strict alignment on ARMv7 architectures,
   conditionally enabling assembly in those cases.
   <li> Fixed a memory leak in libtls when reusing a tls_config.
   <li> Merged more DTLS support into the regular TLS code path, removing
   duplicated code.

Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and

To install, burn cd63.iso on a CD-R, put it in the CD drive of your
machine and select <i>Install System Software</i> from the System Maintenance
menu. Indigo/Indy/Indigo2 (R4000) systems will not boot automatically from
CD-ROM, and need a proper invocation from the PROM prompt.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<p>
<li>
If your machine doesn't have a CD drive, you can setup a DHCP/tftp network
server, and boot using "bootp()/bsd.rd.IP##" using the kernel matching your
system type. Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.
<p>
<li>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy63.fs</i> or <i>floppyB63.fs</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.
<p>
<li>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.
<p>
<li>
You can also write <i>miniroot63.fs</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.
<p>
<li>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3 id="upgrade"><font color="#0000e0">How to upgrade</font></h3>

If you already have an OpenBSD 6.2 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade63.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
<p>

<hr>

<h3 id="sourcecode"><font color="#0000e0">Notes about the source code</font></h3>

<tt>src.tar.gz</tt> contains a source archive starting at <tt>/usr/src</tt>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mkdir -p /usr/src</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<tt>sys.tar.gz</tt> contains a source archive starting at <tt>/usr/src/sys</tt>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
<p>

<hr>

<h3 id="ports"><font color="#0000e0">Ports Tree</font></h3>

A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/ports</b>
# <b>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_6_3</b>
</pre></blockquote>

[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 6.3 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
