mac68k

<table><tr><td>
<p>
OpenBSD/mac68k used to run on many of the Motorola 680x0-based Apple Macintosh
computers.
It used to require a Motorola 68020 or better processor, with an external
Motorola 68851 PMMU in case of a 68020.

<p>
<strong>The OpenBSD/mac68k port was discontinued after the 5.1 release.</strong>

<h3 id="history"><strong>History:</strong></h3>

<p>
The mac68k port of OpenBSD was derived from NetBSD/mac68k, and it
used to support most of the same hardware as NetBSD.

<p>
Active building and testing of OpenBSD/mac68k was discontinued after
OpenBSD 4.6 due to lack of interest with developers and builder.

<p>
Eventually the lack of a proper firmware interface, requiring the use of a
MacOS application as the bootloader, with little or no possibility of updating
this application to match progress in OpenBSD (let alone rebuild it with a
free software toolchain) convinced the developers to give up supporting this
port, and remove the code from the tree.

<h4>Supported models</h4>

<p>
OpenBSD/mac68k used to run on a large part of the 680x0-based Macintosh
computers.
The kernel itself had support for the following processor combinations:
<ul>
  <li>68020 with 68851 PMMU and 68881 FPU
  <li>68030 with 68882 FPU
  <li>68040 (<strong>not</strong> including the 68LC040)
</ul>

<p>
The following Macintosh models used to be supported and tested.
This means that at least the SCSI controller, serial console and on-board
ethernet would function on these models.
On some of these machines, a full 68040 CPU was required to replace the
default 68LC040 CPU.
<ul>
<li>Classic family: SE30
<li>LC family: LC, LC II, LC III, LC III+, LC475, Performa 400-430, Performa 450, Performa 460, Performa 475, Performa 476
<li>Centris family: 610, 650
<li>Quadra family: 605, 610, 630, 650, 660AV, 700, 800, 840AV, 900, 950
</ul>

<h4>Supported devices</h4>

<ul>

<li>Internal video and most NuBus video cards
(<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mac68k/macfb.4">macfb</a>).
<li>Both internal serial ports
(<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mac68k/zsc.4">zsc</a>).
<li>ADB keyboards and mice
(<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mac68k/adb.4">adb</a>) (except on the IIfx, Quadra 900 and 950).
<li>Ethernet cards based on the Natl. Semiconductor 8390 (Asante, Apple, and a few others)
(<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mac68k/ae.4">ae</a>).
<li>Quadra/Centris AV series' onboard MACE ethernet
(<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mac68k/mc.4">mc</a>).
<li>Some ethernet cards based on the SONIC chip including internal Ethernet on many of Apple's non-AV Quadras/Centrises
(<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mac68k/sn.4">sn</a>).
</ul>

<h4>Untested systems</h4>

<p>
The following Macintosh models used to be untested, and/or lacked support for
major subsystems.

<ul>
<li>Classic family: Color Classic, Classic II
<li>Macintosh II family: Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci, IIsi, IIfx, IIvi, IIvx, Performa 600
<li>500 family: 520, 550, 575, 580, Mac TV
</ul>

<h4>Unsupported systems</h4>

<ul>
<li>PowerPC-based Macs. Some of these are supported in the
  <a href="macppc.html">OpenBSD/macppc</a> port.
<li>Powerbook family. Hardware capabilities limit the usability of these
  systems.
<li>Machines based on the 68LC040 processor.
  Unfortunately, the chip itself contains a major bug for which there is
  no software workaround available in OpenBSD.
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Unsupported devices</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Communication Slot (CS) ethernet cards.
<li>Any other NuBus card not listed above.
<li>Floppy drive.
<li>IOP ADB subsystem on the IIfx, Quadra 900 and 950.
<li>IDE drives.
</ul>
