<i>AMS-IX deployed two OpenBGPD route servers end of 2009. Each is currently
running with over 350 route server client sessions, altogether announcing 
over 38000 prefixes. The support we got from the developers over the past 
year has been amazing, every bug or issue found has been fixed as soon as 
possible and features have been added for us. Thanks and keep up
the good work!

<i>I first switched two of our routers from Zebra to OpenBGPD after
finding a problem we suspected was in Zebra.  As it turned out, the
problem itself was deep inside OpenBSD, solved in the then-current
kernel, but once I'd made the switch I liked what I saw and we've
stuck with OpenBGPD.<br>
I've found some bugs, but unlike in some other projects they were
resolved rather quickly in spite of being difficult to reproduce, and
OpenBGPD seems quite stable now.  Thanks, guys!

<i>We have been using OpenBSD for all of our routing, bridging, internet
servers, firewalls, VPN, etc. since we started the company.
Our growth had forced us to install a second fiber connection and
implement BGP.  We have been running bgpd on OpenBSD since August 2004,
and bgpd has been extremely stable.  To date, we have not had any
problems - it just works.  We run bgpd on a P3 866 with 512 MB of RAM.
We route over 800 GB of internet bound traffic every month.
We are very impressed with the work that the OpenBSD project does, and
we appreciate the quality, stability, functionality and security that
the operating system provides for us, but more important, we are
grateful and appreciate the hard work and dedication of the team. Thank
you OpenBSD.

<i>We were in the situation where we needed to upgrade from a Cisco 3600
due to the expanding bgp routing table and a seriously lacking cpu.  To
do what we needed to do would have required a Juniper or a high end
Cisco.  Instead we tried OpenBSD with OpenBGPD and pf on a low end
Opteron processor.  The result was nothing short of shocking!  Three
full views with 700 Meg of memory to spare.  CPU utilization between 5%
and 20%.  The ability to alter traffic filters using pf without
worrying about the CPU.  Full Unix-like environment with things like   
tcpdump.  In short, it's the best hardware, software decision we ever
made and it has literally changed the services we can offer.  I very
much prefer OpenBSD, OpenBGPD, and pf to any other solution.  It
actually brought tears to my eyes during our first few days of use.
It's that good.</i>

<i>I just wanted to tell  that I am a very happy user of
OpenBGPD (and OpenBSD for years). We started out with zebra on OpenBSD
2.8 or 2.9 and OpenBGPD since 3.8. Now we run OpenBSD 3.9 (since
yesterday) with OpenBGPD. Everything even remotely important
runs OpenBSD here ;)  We also provide businesses with dsl and
soekris/openbsd routers etc etc. We are moving to a new server room at
one of the facilities that host the AMS-IX (and NL-IX) exchanges and I
will set up redundant CARP/BGP (maybe OSPF) for our network there. We
have around 160 peers and three transit providers and my life is sooo
much easier than it was with zebra! Thanks dude!</i>

<i>
As a 'full service offering' company, every aspect of our business is
critical. Hence using Cisco routers was a simple choice 5 years ago when
we started offering enterprise hosting. But as our clients needs
continue to grow, our service offerings also need to improve. Looking at
upgrading our network infrastructure recently, I was shocked at the cost
of implementing BGP on our Cisco gear - the extra router, the RAM
upgrades, the maintenance! Having used OpenBSD as our internal firewall
for over 7 years, I was familiar with it, so decided to give OpenBGPd a
try and WOW, its impressive. Replacing our core router was SIMPLE, and
it just worked! For the cost of just the Cisco RAM upgrade and one year
support, we have a complete OpenBSD / OpenBGP based BGP infrastructure.

We mainly provide web-, image- and media- services for other
designers and publishers. We were unhappy with our old Cisco router
that was ineffective and biased traffic incorrectly over transit
lines. It didn't support a full BGP table and crashed if we added too
many peers. Now we run OpenBGP, with full tables and peering with
approx 40 peers (at NIX), and traffic runs much smoother.

<i>
We handle a &quot;small&quot; academic network whose connectivity relies on
about 150mbit of bandwith carried over 3 BGP peerings feeding us the
full routing table. We serve a cluster of cancer research
institutions which live mostly with public donations and research
grants.
The &quot;routers&quot; for this are two entry-level Sun/amd64 boxes costed
less than 1000 euro each which run FreeBSD and carp/OpenBGPD. We
never saw the load on the machines and/or memory grow beyond 5% on
the main router (the other just sits there waiting).

We are incredibly happy of the performance, stability and simplicity
of OpenBGPD and we really thank you for this piece of software which
saved us tens of thousands of euros that have been thus used for
research activities and otherwise would have gone in the pocket of
some big company now. The only time we had a configuration problem we
wrote to the OpenBSD mailing list and got an answer with the solution
38 minutes later, that &quot;big company&quot; support team should learn
something.

  In every city we have 2 OpenBGPD route-servers with fullytransparent
  services - local pl-ix (peering between companies in one city)
  and global pl-ix (peering with every company in PL-IX). BGP sessions
  are made between member and PL-IX route-servers.

  Our transit router (transits traffic from/to other Polish IX -
  WIX), also based on OpenBGPD, serves 300Mbps in + 300Mbps out traffic
  with ~100kpackets/s in and ~100kpackets/s and full bgp sessions,
  and since we started it we forgot about that box - it just works.

  OpenBGPD has given us very stable and reliable platform for PL-IX
  members. During PL-IX startup help of OpenBGPD developers was
  extremely useful, and what is the most important, response times for
  our problems were amazing. Big companies with well-payed-support
  should learn from you.

We have been using OpenBGP since shortly before OpenBSD 3.9 was
released.  We were upgrading our Internet connections and our existing
Cisco router was already struggling.   We were looking at having to buy
a big new Cisco router to get the performance we needed.  We were
instead able to buy three Dell servers and run OpenBGP on them for much
less cost and better redundancy than the Cisco router.  The OpenBSD
solution has better performance, and as we continue to add bandwidth, we
should be able to continue using the current servers.  We are running
three full views and everything Just Works.

Our entire BGP setup has been running  FreeBSD/Zebra for a number of years
until we made the transition to OpenBGPD approximately 2 years ago [Jan.
2005]. Besides an immediate performance leap we gained significant production
advantages with tools like 'bgpctl' and 'pfctl' in our multihomed
environment. OpenBSD has with it's OpenBGPD, OpenOSPFD and OpenNTPD provided
us with a rock-solid and truly &quot;One Stop Shopping&quot; BGP solution
for our ever growing business-to-business hosting company.

We are a managed service provider, delivering both front-office SaaS
and traditional hosting services across the EMEA region. High
availability is a big deal for us and our clients. As a result, in the
event of any downtime, our SLAs are backed off with compensation in hard
cash directly from our revenue stream.
<p>
In the first quarter of 2005 we took the decision to become an LIR and
provision our own multi-homing. Having already been familiar with the
reliability and performance of PF/CARP, as well as wishing to avoid the
overhead and vendor lock-in of certain big names, we gave OpenBGPD a go.
<p>
Three years later we are taking a number of full feeds, have seen out
provider outages and rolling upgrades, all without breaking a sweat or
disruption to our services. Many thanks to the OpenBSD team.
