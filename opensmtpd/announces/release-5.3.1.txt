Subject: Announce: OpenSMTPD 5.3.1 released

OpenSMTPD 5.3.1 has just been released and the archives are available at
our main site: www.OpenSMTPD.org

OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the SMTP protocol with some common
extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange e-mails with systems
speaking the SMTP protocol. It implements a fairly large part of RFC5321
and can already cover a large range of use-cases.

It runs on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, MacOSX and Linux.

We would like to thank the OpenSMTPD community for their help in testing
the snapshots, reporting bugs, contributing code and packaging for other
systems.

This is a bugfix release mostly, with just one new feature.
