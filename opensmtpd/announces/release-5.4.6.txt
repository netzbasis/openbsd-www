Subject: Announce: OpenSMTPD 5.4.5 released

OpenSMTPD 5.4.6 has just been released.

OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the SMTP protocol with some common
extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange e-mails with systems
speaking the SMTP protocol. It implements a fairly large part of RFC5321
and can already cover a large range of use-cases.

It runs on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, OSX and Linux.

The archives are now available from the main site at www.OpenSMTPD.org

We would like to thank the OpenSMTPD community for their help in testing
the snapshots, reporting bugs, contributing code and packaging for other
systems.

This is a minor release to fix two local denial of services.

Issues fixed since last stable release (5.4.5):
===============================================

  * fix logic error in the enqueue code allowing a local user to provoke
    a server shutdown.

  * prevent a local user from being able to exhaust descriptors.
