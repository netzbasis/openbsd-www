Subject: Announce: OpenSMTPD 5.4.1 released

OpenSMTPD 5.4.1 has just been released.

OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the SMTP protocol with some common
extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange e-mails with systems
speaking the SMTP protocol. It implements a fairly large part of RFC5321
and can already cover a large range of use-cases.

It runs on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, OSX and Linux.

The archives are now available from the main site at www.OpenSMTPD.org

We would like to thank the OpenSMTPD community for their help in testing
the snapshots, reporting bugs, contributing code and packaging for other
systems.

This is a major release with many new features, many minor bugfixes, and
a lot of internal changes.

New features since last stable release (5.3.3):
===============================================

  * Improved configuration file:
    - removed last known ambiguity in grammar
    - much simpler configuration for TLS-enabled hosts
    - most parameters are now swappable in listen and accept rules
    - conditions may be negated (ie: accept from ! <trusted> ...)
    - forward-only rules can be declared to impose ~/.forward files
    - new "recipient" keyword allows accept rule to provide a whitelist
    - sender and recipient tables accept wildcard in their domains

  /!\ configuration file must be edited with this new release !  /!\
  /!\ please refer to smtpd.conf(5) and use smtpd -nf smtpd.conf /!\
  /!\ to validate.                                               /!\


  * TLS generic improvements:
    - support for TLS Perfect Forward Secrecy
    - support for providing custom CA certificate


  * MTA improvements:
    - mta may now require remote hosts to present valid certificates
    - always attempt TLS before falling back to plaintext
    - always present certificate if one is available

  * SMTP server improvements:
    - inet4-only and inet6-only listeners are now possible
