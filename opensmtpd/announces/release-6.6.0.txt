Subject: Announce: OpenSMTPD 6.6.0 released

OpenSMTPD 6.6.0 has just been released.

OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the SMTP protocol with some common
extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange e-mails with systems
speaking the SMTP protocol. It implements a fairly large part of RFC5321
and can already cover a large range of use-cases.

It runs on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD and glibc-based Linux.

The archives are now available from the main site at www.OpenSMTPD.org

We would like to thank the OpenSMTPD community for their help in testing
the snapshots, reporting bugs, contributing code and packaging for other
systems.

This is a major release with multiple bug fixes and new features.


Dependencies note:
==================

This release builds with LibreSSL > 3.0.2 or OpenSSL > 1.1.0.

It's preferable to depend on LibreSSL as OpenSMTPD is written and tested
with that dependency. In addition, the features parity is not respected,
some features will not be available with OpenSSL, like ECDSA server-side
certificates support in this release. OpenSSL library is considered as a
best effort target TLS library and provided as a commodity, LibreSSL has
become our target TLS library.


Changes in this release (since 6.4.0):
======================================

- various improvements to documentation and code
- reverse dns session matching criteria added to smtpd.conf(5)
- regex table lookup support added to smtpd.conf(5)
- introduced support for ECDSA certificates with an ECDSA privsep engine
- introduced builtin filters for basic filtering of incoming sessions
- introduced option to deliver junk to a Junk folder in mail.maildir(8)
- fixed the smtp(1) client so it uses correct default port for SMTPS
- fixed an smtpd(8) crash on excessively large input
- ensured mail rejected by an LMTP server stay queued


Experimental features:

- introduced a filters API to allow writing standalone filters for smtpd
- introduced proxy-v2 support allowing smtpd to operate behind a proxy

Verify:
=======

Starting with version 5.7.1, releases are signed with signify(1).

You can obtain the public key from our website, check with our community
that it has not been altered on its way to your machine.

   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-20181026.pub

Once you are confident the key is correct, you can verify the release as
described below:

1- download both release tarball and matching signature file to same directory:

   for OpenBSD version:
   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.6.0.sum.sig
   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.6.0.tar.gz

   for portable version:
   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.6.0p1.sum.sig
   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.6.0p1.tar.gz


2- use `signify` to verify that signature file is properly signed and that the
   checksum matches the release tarball you downloaded:

   for OpenBSD version:
   $ signify -C -e -p opensmtpd-20181026.pub -x opensmtpd-6.6.0.sum.sig
   Signature Verified
   opensmtpd-6.6.0.tar.gz: OK

   for portable version:
   $ signify -C -e -p opensmtpd-20181026.pub -x opensmtpd-6.6.0p1.sum.sig
   Signature Verified
   opensmtpd-6.6.0p1.tar.gz: OK


If you don't get an OK message, then something is not right and you should not
install without first understanding why it failed.
