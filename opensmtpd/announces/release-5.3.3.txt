Subject: Announce: OpenSMTPD 5.3.3 released

OpenSMTPD 5.3.3 has just been released and the archives are available at
our main site: www.OpenSMTPD.org

OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the SMTP protocol with some common
extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange e-mails with systems
speaking the SMTP protocol. It implements a fairly large part of RFC5321
and can already cover a large range of use-cases.

It runs on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, OSX and Linux.

We would like to thank the OpenSMTPD community for their help in testing
the snapshots, reporting bugs, contributing code and packaging for other
systems.

This is a bugfix and reliability release, no new feature.

=========

  * fix a bug causing possible timeouts of incoming SSL sessions
  * fix a case-folding issue when looking up keys in static tables
