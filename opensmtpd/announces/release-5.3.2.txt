Subject: Announce: OpenSMTPD 5.3.2 released

OpenSMTPD 5.3.2 has just been released and the archives are available at
our main site: www.OpenSMTPD.org

OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the SMTP protocol with some common
extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange e-mails with systems
speaking the SMTP protocol. It implements a fairly large part of RFC5321
and can already cover a large range of use-cases.

It runs on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD and Linux.

We would like to thank the OpenSMTPD community for their help in testing
the snapshots, reporting bugs, contributing code and packaging for other
systems.

This is a bugfix and reliability release mostly, with few new features.


Features:
=========

  * add support for transparent queue compression
  * fsqueue now keeps a safety disk space / inode 5% reserve
  * add SECURE and AUTH transmission type as specified in rfc3848
  * add db(3) support for "helo" lookups
  * make "source" no longer required for "helo" lookups
  * add check to ensure smtpd and smtpctl are "compatible"
  * add new "error" alias kind to have an alias return 4xx or 5xx
  * source and session are now logged when relaying
  * make OpenSMTPD cope gracefully with many former "fatal" cases
  * detect and cope with "corrupted" envelopes at runtime
  * smtpd -d no longer implies "debug" logging
  * smtpd -v no longer requires -d to output debug logging
  * traces no longer require -dv and can be (de)activated at runtime

  * add support for Unix sockets in local LMTP deliveries

[1] bug exists in both native and portable version but DoS doesn't
    seem to trigger on OpenBSD. you should update still.
