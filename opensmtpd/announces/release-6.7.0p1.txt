Subject: Announce: OpenSMTPD 6.7.0p1 released

OpenSMTPD 6.7.0p1 has just been released.

OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the SMTP protocol with some common
extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange e-mails with systems
speaking the SMTP protocol. It implements a fairly large part of RFC5321
and can already cover a large range of use-cases.

It runs on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, Linux and OSX.

The archives are now available from the main site at www.OpenSMTPD.org

We would like to thank the OpenSMTPD community for their help in testing
the snapshots, reporting bugs, contributing code and packaging for other
systems.

This is a major release with multiple bug fixes and new features.


Dependencies note:
==================

This release builds with LibreSSL > 3.0.2 or OpenSSL > 1.1.0.

It's preferable to depend on LibreSSL as OpenSMTPD is written and tested
with that dependency. In addition, the features parity is not respected,
some features will not be available with OpenSSL, like ECDSA server-side
certificates support in this release. OpenSSL library is considered as a
best effort target TLS library and provided as a commodity, LibreSSL has
become our target TLS library.


Changes in this release:
========================

New Features:

- Allowed use of the smtpd(8) session username in built-in filters when available.
- Introduced a bypass keyword to smtpd(8) so that built-in filters can bypass processing when a condition is met.
- Allowed use of 'auth' as an origin in smtpd.conf(5).
- Allowed use of mail-from and rctp-to as for and from parameters in smtpd.conf(5).


Bug fixes:

- Ensured legacy ssl(8) session ID is persistent during a client TLS session, fixing an issue using TLSv1.3 with smtp.mail.yahoo.com.
- Fixed security vulnerabilities in smtpd(8). Corrected an out-of-bounds read in smtpd allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the envelope file to be executed as root, and ensured privilege revocation in smtpctl(8) to prevent arbitrary commands from being run with the _smtpq group.
- Allowed mail.local(8) to be run as non-root, opening a pipe to lockspool(1) for file locking.
- Fixed a security vulnerability in smtpd(8) which could lead to a privilege escalation on mbox deliveries and unprivileged code execution on lmtp deliveries.
- Added support for CIDR in a: spf atoms in smtpd(8).
- Fixed a possible crash in smtpd(8) when combining "from rdns" with nested virtual aliases under a particular configuration.


Experimental Features: 

- Introduced smtp-out event reporting.
- Improved filtering protocol.


Checksums:

  SHA256 (opensmtpd-6.7.0p1.tar.gz) =

Verify:
=======

Starting with version 5.7.1, releases are signed with signify(1).

You can obtain the public key from our website, check with our community
that it has not been altered on its way to your machine.

   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-20181026.pub

Once you are confident the key is correct, you can verify the release as
described below:

1- download both release tarball and matching signature file to same directory:

   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.7.0p1.sum.sig
   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.7.0p1.tar.gz


2- use `signify` to verify that signature file is properly signed and that the
   checksum matches the release tarball you downloaded:

   for portable version:
   $ signify -C -e -p opensmtpd-20181026.pub -x opensmtpd-6.7.0p1.sum.sig
   Signature Verified
   opensmtpd-6.7.0p1.tar.gz: OK


If you don't get an OK message, then something is not right and you should not
install without first understanding why it failed.
