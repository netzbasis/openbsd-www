Subject: Announce: OpenSMTPD 5.4.5 released

OpenSMTPD 5.4.5 has just been released.

OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the SMTP protocol with some common
extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange e-mails with systems
speaking the SMTP protocol. It implements a fairly large part of RFC5321
and can already cover a large range of use-cases.

It runs on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, OSX and Linux.

The archives are now available from the main site at www.OpenSMTPD.org

We would like to thank the OpenSMTPD community for their help in testing
the snapshots, reporting bugs, contributing code and packaging for other
systems.

This is a minor release with bugfixes only.

New features since last stable release (5.4.4):
===============================================

  * remove a hack introduced a very long time ago and which leads
    to a crash when OpenSMTPD is built with gcc's FORTIFY option.

  * fix a getlogin()-related issue leading to invalid sender when
    an application enqueues mail on behalf of a user.

  * fix a logic error in the SNI code leading to [1]:
    - possible unexpected disconnect of some clients;
    - possible invalid SNI certificate being presented to some clients;
    - possible crash of the daemon.
