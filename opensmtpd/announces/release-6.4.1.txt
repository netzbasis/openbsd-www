Subject: Announce: OpenSMTPD 6.4.1 released

OpenSMTPD 6.4.1 has just been released.

OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the SMTP protocol with some common
extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange e-mails with systems
speaking the SMTP protocol. It implements a fairly large part of RFC5321
and can already cover a large range of use-cases.

It runs on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD and Linux.

The archives are now available from the main site at www.OpenSMTPD.org

We would like to thank the OpenSMTPD community for their help in testing
the snapshots, reporting bugs, contributing code and packaging for other
systems.

This is a minor release with critical and portability fixes.

Changes in this release (since 6.4.0):
======================================

- MDA exit status was improperly handled causing some temporary failures
  to be treated as permanent failures.
- fix hardcoded libexec paths preventing proper packaging [1]
- fix install of smtpctl to allow build/install as non-root

Verify:
=======

Starting with version 5.7.1, releases are signed with signify(1).

You can obtain the public key from our website, check with our community
that it has not been altered on its way to your machine.

   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-20181026.pub

Once you are confident the key is correct, you can verify the release as
described below:

1- download both release tarball and matching signature file to same directory:

   for OpenBSD version:
   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.4.1.sum.sig
   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.4.1.tar.gz

   for portable version:
   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.4.1p1.sum.sig
   $ wget https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.4.1p1.tar.gz


2- use `signify` to verify that signature file is properly signed and that the
   checksum matches the release tarball you downloaded:

   for OpenBSD version:
   $ signify -C -e -p opensmtpd-20181026.pub -x opensmtpd-6.4.1.sum.sig
   Signature Verified
   opensmtpd-6.4.1.tar.gz: OK

   for portable version:
   $ signify -C -e -p opensmtpd-20181026.pub -x opensmtpd-6.4.1p1.sum.sig
   Signature Verified
   opensmtpd-6.4.1p1.tar.gz: OK


If you don't get an OK message, then something is not right and you should not
install without first understanding why it failed.
