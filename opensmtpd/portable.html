<i>Open</i><b>SMTPD</b></a>
Portable Release
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Normal OpenSMTPD development produces a very small, secure, and easy to
maintain version for the OpenBSD project.
The portability team takes that pure version and adds portability code
so that OpenSMTPD can run on many other operating systems.
However, the portability teams does not package for the other operating
systems and users of these systems are encouraged to package and get in
touch with us.

<p>
OpenSMTPD runs on the following Unix operating systems:

<ul>
<li>OpenBSD
<li>FreeBSD
<li>NetBSD
<li>DragonFlyBSD
<li>Linux
<li>SmartOS
<li>Mac OS X
</ul>

Because stable releases don't spawn magically,
systems and distributions are only supported if package maintainers provide regular
feedback during the development cycle.

<p>
OpenSMTPD is known to build on all
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/plat.html">architectures</a>
supported by OpenBSD.

<p>
All combinations of systems / architectures have not been tested but should work, if they
don't let us know so we can fix.

<p>
The portable OpenSMTPD follows development of the official version, but
releases are not synchronized. Portable releases are marked with a 'p'
(e.g. 6.6.0p1). The official OpenBSD source will never use the 'p' suffix.
