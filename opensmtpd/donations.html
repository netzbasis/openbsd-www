<h3>Donations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
The OpenSMTPD project is developed by volunteers and is not backed up by a commercial entity.

<p>
As a general rule, you can help the project by donating to the
<a href="https://www.openbsdfoundation.org">OpenBSD foundation</a> whose goal is to fund
OpenBSD and related projects, including LibreSSL upon which we rely. The donations make
the OpenBSD infrastructure better and lets OpenBSD organize hackathons where we tend to
do a LOT more work than usual.

<p>
Alternatively, if you wish to make a donation to the
OpenSMTPD project itself or to a specific developer,
you can use the button below or send a paypal to
<a href="mailto:donations@opensmtpd.org">donations@opensmtpd.org</a>
letting us know in the comment where this should go.

<p>
      <form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
	<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick">
	<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="VCQ8WF6KE2YNW">
	<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!">

<p>
Finally,
some developers are enrolled in community-funding programs,
whereas others may be contracted to work on sponsored development and issue invoices.

<p>
Feel free to reach out to the developers through the mailing list,
direct e-mail or official IRC channel (#opensmtpd @ freenode) to get more details.
