<p>
OpenSMTPD (from here on referred to as smtpd) is a FREE implementation
of the server-side SMTP protocol as defined by
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321">RFC 5321</a>, with some
additional standard extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange
emails with other systems speaking the SMTP protocol. Started out of
dissatisfaction with other implementations,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=smtpd&amp;sec=8">smtpd(8)</a>
is a fairly complete SMTP implementation.

<p>
It is primarily developed by Gilles Chehade, Eric Faurot,
Charles Longeau, and Sunil Nimmagadda, with contributions from various
OpenBSD hackers.

<p>
This set of documents is intended as a general introduction to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=smtpd&amp;sec=8">smtpd(8)</a>
as used on OpenBSD.  Even if it covers most of smtpd's features, it is
only intended to be used as a supplement to the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi">man pages</a>, and not
as a replacement for them.  For a complete and in-depth view, please
start by reading the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=smtpd&amp;sec=8">smtpd(8)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=smtpd.conf&amp;sec=5">smtpd.conf(5)</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=smtpctl&amp;sec=8">smtpctl(8)</a>
man pages.

<p>
As with the rest of the FAQ, this set of documents is focused on users
of the most current release of OpenBSD. As
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=smtpd&amp;sec=8">smtpd(8)</a>
is always growing and developing, there are changes and enhancements
between the OpenBSD release version and the version in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/plus.html">-current</a>.  There are also
differences between the current version and earlier versions.  The
reader is advised to see the man pages for the version of OpenBSD they
are currently working with.
