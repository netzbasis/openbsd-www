<p>
OpenSMTPD (from here on referred to as smtpd) is a FREE implementation
of the server-side SMTP protocol as defined by
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321">RFC 5321</a>, with some
additional standard extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange
emails with other systems speaking the SMTP protocol. Started out of
dissatisfaction with other implementations,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd">smtpd(8)</a> is a fairly complete
SMTP implementation.

<p>
It is primarily developed by Gilles Chehade, Eric Faurot, Charles Longeau
and Sunil Nimmagadda, with contributions from various OpenBSD hackers.

<p>
This set of documents is intended as a general introduction to
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd">smtpd(8)</a> as used on OpenBSD.
Even if it covers most of smtpd's features, it is only intended to be used
as a supplement to the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org">man pages</a>, and
not as a replacement for them.
For a complete and in-depth view, please start by reading the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd">smtpd(8)</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.conf">smtpd.conf(5)</a> and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpctl">smtpctl(8)</a> man pages.

<p>
As with the rest of the FAQ, this set of documents is focused on users
of the most current release of OpenBSD.
As <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd">smtpd(8)</a> is always growing
and developing, there are changes and enhancements between the OpenBSD
release version and the version in
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/plus.html">-current</a>.
There are also differences between the current version and earlier versions.
The reader is advised to see the man pages for the version of OpenBSD they
are currently working with.
