<p>
OpenSMTPD (from here on referred to as smtpd) is a FREE implementation
of the server-side SMTP protocol as defined by RFC 5321, with some
additional standard extensions. It allows ordinary machines to exchange
e-mails with other systems speaking the SMTP protocol. Started out of
dissatisfaction with other implementations, OpenSMTPD nowadays is a
fairly complete SMTP implementation.

<p>
OpenSMTPD is primarily developed by Gilles Chehade, Eric Faurot and
Charles Longeau; with contributions from various OpenBSD hackers.

<p>
This set of documents is intended as a general introduction to OpenSMTPD
as run on OpenBSD. Even if it covers most of OpenSMTP's features, it is
only intended to be used as a supplement to the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi">man pages</a>,
and not as a replacement for them.

<p>
For a complete and in-depth view of what OpenSMTPD can do, please start
by reading the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=smtpd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+5.1"
>smtpd(8)</a> man page.

<p>
As with the rest of the FAQ, this set of documents is focused on users of
<a href="../../51.html">OpenBSD 5.1</a>.
As OpenSMTPD is always growing and developing, there are changes and
enhancements between the
5.1-release
version and the version in OpenBSD-current as well as differences
between
5.1 
and earlier versions.
The reader is advised to see the man pages for the version of OpenBSD
they are currently working with.
