Goals
</h2>
<hr>

<ul>
<li>Stay as compatible as possible with GNU cvs without compromising the
security of the system.
<li>Be as secure as possible. Code carefully, do strict validity checks
especially in the network input path, and use bounded buffer operations.
<li>Provide a much better access control on repository files.
</ul>
