      OpenCVS is to be released soon.

<p>
OpenCVS is a <strong>FREE</strong> implementation of the Concurrent Versions System,
the most popular open source revision control software.
It can be used as both client and server for repositories and provides
granular access control over data stored in the repository.
It aims to be as compatible as possible with other CVS implementations,
except when particular features reduce the overall security of the
system.

<p>
The OpenCVS project was started after discussions regarding the latest
GNU CVS vulnerabilities that came out.
Although CVS is widely used, its development has been mostly stagnant in
the last years and many security issues have popped up, both in the
implementation and in the mechanisms.

<p>
OpenCVS is developed by <a href="https://www.openbsd.org">the OpenBSD Project</a>.
The software is freely usable and re-usable by everyone under
a BSD license.

<!--
<p>
The OpenBSD project sells
<a href="https://openbsdstore.com">CDs, T-shirts and posters</a>.
Sales of these items help to fund development.
