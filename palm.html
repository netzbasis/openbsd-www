<p>
OpenBSD/palm was an experimental port of OpenBSD that used to run on PDAs made
by Palm with an ARM PXA2xx processor.

<p>
There was never an official release of the OpenBSD/palm port.

<p>
<strong>The OpenBSD/palm port was discontinued after the 5.3 release.</strong>

<h3 id="history"><strong>History</strong></h3>

<p>
The Palm port was started as a fork of the Zaurus port in March 2009 with the
intention to make the system run on Palm Tungsten|T5. The project was later
approved as a semestral work at the <a href="http://www.ksi.mff.cuni.cz/en/">
Department of Software Engineering</a>, <a
href="http://www.mff.cuni.cz/toISO-8859-2.en/">Faculty
of Mathematics and Physics</a>, <a href="http://www.cuni.cz/UKENG-1.html">
Charles University in Prague</a> mentored by <a
href="http://www.egothor.org/~galambos/">Leo Galambos</a>.

<p>
As the project advanced, support for more Palm devices was added as well as
support for various peripherals and the project outgrew the initial agreement
for the semestral project.

<h3 id="status"><strong>Current status</strong></h3>

<p>
OpenBSD/palm had been tested and was known to be working on the following
models: Tungsten|T5, T|X, LifeDrive and the Zire72. There was also initial
support for the Palm Tungsten|C.

<p>
Support included the LCD, buttons, USB host (through a hub with external
power supply), PXA SD/MMC controller and UART (not available on Zire72). 
On Palm LifeDrive there is also a driver for the builtin hard drive.
