<hr>

OpenBSD/amiga used to run on the Amiga machines manufactured by Commodore.
It used to require a Motorola 68020 or better processor, with an external
Motorola 68851 PMMU in case of a 68020.
This left out models 500, 600 and 1000 which can not receive accelerator
boards.
<p>

<strong>The OpenBSD/amiga port was discontinued after the 3.2 release.</strong>

<a name="history"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The OpenBSD/amiga was initially derived from NetBSD/amiga in 1995, and
used to loosely track the NetBSD changes until 1998. Niklas Hallqvist also
wrote a new interrupt remapping system, improving average performance,
revamped the installation media, and ported the ISA bus support to a
big-endian platform, for GoldenGate II and CrossLink cards.
</p>

<p>
After a few years, due to the lack of users, this port was slowly left in
oblivion, although releases were still being made. Eventually, it was decided
to stop supporting it and remove the code from the tree.
