<h3 id="history"><font color="#0000e0"><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>
<p>
OpenBSD/octeon began in 2010 with an SDK created by
<a href="http://www.iij.ad.jp/en/index.html">IIJ</a> and donated to OpenBSD.
Early work targeted the Portwell CAM-0100.
<p>
Due to the lack of available hardware, the port lay dormant for a few years.
This changed in January 2013 with the release of the Ubiquiti Networks
EdgeRouter LITE. Several developers obtained these new machines, and work
began immediately. Due to issues with USB support, the port to the Portwell
CAM-0100 matured first because it allowed CF cards to be used as a storage
medium.
<p>
Development has been rapid, with the port to the Portwell CAM-0100 becoming
self-hosting in April 2013.
In August 2013 the DSR-500 model reached userland and could host OpenBSD
via NFS.
Support for EdgeRouter LITE Ethernet was added in
September 2013, allowing the EdgeRouter LITE to be usable by NFS booting.
<p>
In June 2015 USB support was added which finally allowed installing to
local disk on machines lacking a CF slot.
