<h3 id="new"><font color="#0000e0">What's New</font></h3>

This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 6.5.
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="plus65.html">changelog</a> leading
to 6.5.

    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>
        is now provided on mips64.
    <li>octeon: Now the system automatically detects the number of available
        cores. However, manual setting of the numcores, or coremask,
        boot parameter is still needed to enable secondary cores.
    <li>octeon: It is now possible to use the root disk's DUID as the value
        of the rootdev boot parameter.
    </ul>

<p>

<li>IEEE 802.11 wireless stack improvements:
<p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>
Write <i>floppy65.fs</i> or <i>floppyB65.fs</i> (depending on your machine)
to a diskette and enter <i>boot dva0</i>.

If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install65.fs</i> or
<i>miniroot65.fs</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.
<p>
<li>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and

To install, burn cd65.iso on a CD-R, put it in the CD drive of your
machine and select <i>Install System Software</i> from the System Maintenance
menu. Indigo/Indy/Indigo2 (R4000) systems will not boot automatically from
CD-ROM, and need a proper invocation from the PROM prompt.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<p>
<li>
If your machine doesn't have a CD drive, you can setup a DHCP/tftp network
server, and boot using "bootp()/bsd.rd.IP##" using the kernel matching your
system type. Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.
</ul>

<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/sparc64:</font></h3>

Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.
<p>
<li>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy65.fs</i> or <i>floppyB65.fs</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.
<p>
<li>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.
<p>
<li>
You can also write <i>miniroot65.fs</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.
<p>
<li>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3 id="upgrade"><font color="#0000e0">How to upgrade</font></h3>

If you already have an OpenBSD 6.4 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade65.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
<p>

<hr>

<h3 id="sourcecode"><font color="#0000e0">Notes about the source code</font></h3>

<tt>src.tar.gz</tt> contains a source archive starting at <tt>/usr/src</tt>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mkdir -p /usr/src</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<tt>sys.tar.gz</tt> contains a source archive starting at <tt>/usr/src/sys</tt>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
<p>

<hr>

<h3 id="ports"><font color="#0000e0">Ports Tree</font></h3>

A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr</b>
# <b>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/ports</b>
# <b>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_6_5</b>
</pre></blockquote>

[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 6.5 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
