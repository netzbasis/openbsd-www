rpki-client 6.6p1 has just been released. It is the first portable release of
the rpki-client code, available in OpenBSD.

It will be available from the mirrors listed at
http://www.rpki-client.org/ shortly.

rpki-client is a FREE, easy-to-use implementation of the Resource
Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) for Relying Parties (RP) to
facilitate validation of the Route Origin of a BGP announcement. The
program queries the RPKI repository system and outputs Validated ROA
Payloads in the configuration format of OpenBGPD, BIRD, and also as
CSV or JSON objects for consumption by other routing stacks.

See RFC 6811 for a description of how BGP Prefix Origin Validation
secures the Internet's global routing system.

rpki-client was primarily developed by Kristaps Dzonsons, Claudio
Jeker, Job Snijders, and Sebastian Benoit as part of the OpenBSD
Project and gets released as a base component of OpenBSD every six
months.

This first release is based on the OpenBSD source code available in the
OpenBSD CVS repository as of 2020-04-13.
