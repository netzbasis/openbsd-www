Goals
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Our goal is to make ... ubiquitous by providing a free simple implementation
that is secure and easy to configure.

<ul>
<li>Be as <strong>secure</strong> as possible. Code carefully, do strict
    validity checks especially in the network input path, and use
    bounded buffer operations. Use privilege separation to mitigate
    the effects of possible security bugs.

<li>Provide a <strong>lean</strong> implementation, sufficient for a
    majority.  Don't try to support each and every obscure usage
    case, but cover the typical ones.

<li>Try to <strong>"Just Work"</strong> in the background.

</ul>
