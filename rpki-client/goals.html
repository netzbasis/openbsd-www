Goals
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Our goal is to provide a free, secure and easy to use implementation of
the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), the community-driven
technology based on open standards that is aimed at making internet
routing more secure. 

Obviously, each developer working on rpki-client has their own aims and
priorities, but it is possible to classify the goals we all share:

<ul>
<li>Be as <strong>secure</strong> as possible. Code carefully and do strict 
    validity checks especially in the network input path. Use bounded
    buffer operations. Use privilege separation to mitigate the effects
    of possible security bugs.

<li>Provide a <strong>lean</strong> implementation, sufficient for a
    majority.  Don't try to support each and every obscure use case but
    cover the typical ones.

<li>Try to <strong>"Just Work"</strong> in the background.

</ul>
