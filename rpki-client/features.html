<p>
Many ... daemons fail in different areas. Some are complex, follow
archaic design practices, and are difficult to configure. Others are
overly simplistic, only support client-side synchronization, or are
simply immature.

<p>
In an increasingly ...-synchronized world, it is important to have a
free implementation that provides good time synchronization while
still maintaining high security and ease of configurability.

<p>
To satisfy those goals, rpki-client has:

<ul>
<li>A simple and easily understandable codebase.

<li>Privilege separation that isolates the unprivileged networking
    code from the privileged time-setting code. The daemon runs
    in a chroot environment, further limiting its capabilities.

<li>Integrates the latest secure API advances from OpenBSD such as
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getentropy">getentropy(2)</a>,
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/arc4random">arc4random(3)</a>
    (a fail-safe CSRNG that works in chroot environments), and
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/reallocarray">reallocarray(3)</a>
    (an integer overflow-checking malloc/calloc/realloc replacement).

</ul>
