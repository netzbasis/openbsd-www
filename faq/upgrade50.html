<i>Note: Upgrades are only supported from one release to the release
immediately following it.
Do not skip releases.</i>

<p><i>
It is highly recommended that you read through and fully understand
this process before attempting it.
If you are doing it on a critical or physically remote machine, it is
recommended that you test this process on an identical, local system to
verify its success before attempting on a critical or remote computer.
</i>

<p>
Upgrading is a convenient way to bring your OpenBSD system up to the most
recent version.
However, the results are not intended to precisely match the results of
a wipe-and-reload installation.
Old library files in particular are not removed in the upgrade process,
as they may be required by older applications that may or may not be
upgraded at this time.
If you REALLY wish to get rid of all these old files, you are probably
better off reinstalling from scratch.

<h2 id="before">Before upgrading: things to think about and be aware of</h2>
This is <i>not</i> a complete list of the changes that took place
between 4.9 and 5.0, but rather some of the important things that will
impact a large number of users in the upgrade process.
For a more complete list of changes, see
<a href="../plus50.html">plus50.html</a> and the CVS change logs.

<ul>
<li id="rc.d"><b>System daemons now started through <tt>/etc/rc.d</tt>:</b><br>
Daemons are only started, though, if they are enabled in
<tt>rc.conf.local</tt>.
For the most part, this won't create an issue; before you
<a href="#final">update <tt>/etc</tt></a>, the system will come up the
"old" way, after you update <tt>/etc</tt>, the system will start the
new way.
The files <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt> and <tt>/etc/rc.shutdown</tt> had some
important changes for this (and likely your local customization), so
they need to be handled carefully (and manually) during the upgrade.

<p>
<b><tt>rc.conf</tt> 'rc_scripts' variable renamed to 'pkg_scripts':</b>
This change was introduced to make it clear that <tt>pkg_scripts</tt> should only be used to store
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/packages.7">packages(7)</a>
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.d.8">rc.d(8)</a>
scripts names.

<p>
<li id="ypserv"><b>ypserv(8)</b> must be explicitly invoked in <tt>rc.conf.local</tt><br>
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypserv.8">ypserv(8)</a>
is one exception to the <a href="#rc.d">above</a>, if your machine is a
YP server, before the update, add the line:
<blockquote><pre>
ypserv_flags=""
</pre></blockquote>
to your <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt>.

<p>
<li id="pf"><b>PF changes requiring changes to your pf.conf rules</b><br>
<b><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ftp-proxy.8">ftp-proxy(8)</a>
and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tftp-proxy.8">tftp-proxy(8)</a>
have changed:</b> They now use <tt>divert-to</tt> instead of <tt>rdr-to</tt>,
which improves performance.
Old rules like these:
<blockquote><pre>
pass in quick proto tcp to port ftp rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port 8021
pass in quick on internal proto udp to port tftp rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port 6969
</pre></blockquote>
should be replaced with:
<blockquote><pre>
pass in quick inet proto tcp to port ftp divert-to 127.0.0.1 port 8021
pass in quick on internal inet proto udp to port tftp divert-to 127.0.0.1 port 6969
</pre></blockquote>
Note that with divert-to, the address family (in this example inet) must
be specified explicitly.

<p>
<b>pf.conf 'set skip' now handles groups:</b>
In pf.conf, '<tt>set skip on &lt;...&gt;</tt>' now works with interface groups.
Previously if an interface type (without number) was used, e.g. '<tt>set skip
on vlan</tt>' or '<tt>set skip on em</tt>' was used, it would have the
undocumented behaviour of matching any interface of that type.
Now it will only match an interface which is a member of the named group.

<p>
This results in changed behaviour for some users:
If you currently use "set skip" with a physical interface type (e.g.
"<tt>set skip on ix</tt>") you will need to add the interface to a group
of that name: '<tt>ifconfig ix0 group ix</tt>' or add '<tt>group ix</tt>'
to hostname.ix0.

<p>
Interfaces cloned at runtime (e.g. lo, trunk, vlan, pppoe, carp, gif,
mpe and others) default to being in a group named after the interface type,
so for these interfaces there will be no change in behaviour unless you
have deliberately changed groups, e.g. with '<tt>ifconfig carp456 -group
carp</tt>'.

<p>
<b>The
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf.5">pf.conf(5)</a>
<tt>set require-order</tt> option has been removed:</b> You must remove it
from any ruleset which uses it or the ruleset will not load.
This option was used to relax requirements on ruleset ordering; these
have not been enforced by default for some time.

<p>
<li id="security"><b>New
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/security.8">security(8)</a>
script</b>
If you have added code to the file <tt>/etc/security</tt>, move that
code to <tt>/etc/daily.local</tt>.
The file <tt>/etc/security</tt> will be deleted, it has been replaced by
the file <tt>/usr/libexec/security</tt> now contained in the base file
set.

<p>
<li id="vnd"><b>vnd(4) removed, svnd(4) renamed to vnd(4):</b><br>
The traditional vnd(4) that bypasses the buffer cache has been removed,
and svnd(4) has been renamed to vnd(4).
It is also no longer possible to swap to vnds.
Users running current will notice that the kernel will treat svndX and
vndX as the same device from now, so older svnd device nodes will
continue to function.

<p>
<li id="xkb"><b>Xenocara switched to xkeyboard-config</b>
Keyboard definition files from the old xkb-data package in
/etc/X11/xkb have been replaced by files from
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/XKeyboardConfig">xkeyboard-config</a>,
which are now  installed in /usr/X11R6/share/X11/xkb.
If you have an <tt>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</tt> file that exists mainly
to set keyboard type and nationality that file should be removed,
otherwise you may find yourself without keyboard functionality in X.

<p>
<li id="timed"><b>timed(8) removed</b>
timed has been removed.  Switch your timekeeping over to
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ntpd.8">ntpd(8)</a>.
Also, rdate(8) as an rc startup option has been removed, you can use
ntpd(8) with appropriate flags if desired.

<p>
<li id="kern"><b>Modified kernel:</b><br>
Check whether you have made any modifications to your kernel.
For example, you might have modified your network device to use a
non-default setting using config(8).
Note your changes, so you can repeat them for the new 5.0 kernel.

</ul>

<p>

<h2 id="upgrade">The upgrade process</h2>

<h3>Upgrading by install kernel</h3>
If you have access to the system's console, the easiest and safest way
to upgrade is to boot from the install kernel by boot media or
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> and follow the upgrade steps,
which are very similar to the <a href="faq4.html">install process</a>.

<p>
Afterwards, complete the upgrade by following the <a href="#final">final
steps</a> as detailed below.

<p>
One easy way to boot from the install kernel is to place the 5.0 version
of <i>bsd.rd</i> in the root of your boot drive, then instruct the boot loader
to boot using this new <i>bsd.rd</i> file.
On amd64 and i386, you do this by entering "<tt>boot bsd.rd</tt>" at the
initial <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt.

<h3>Upgrading without install kernel</h3>
<i>This is NOT the recommended process.  Use the install kernel method
if at all possible!</i>

<p>
Sometimes, one needs to do an upgrade of a machine when one can't easily
use the normal upgrade process.
The most common case is when the machine is in a remote location and you
don't have easy access to the system console.
One can usually do this by carefully following this process:

<ul>
<li><b>Place install files in a "good" location</b>.
Make sure you have sufficient space!

<p>
<li><b>Become root with ksh(1):</b>
While using
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sudo.8">sudo(8)</a>
before each command is generally a good practice, the sudo(8) command
will be broken by the last steps, so you should be root before starting
this process.
Also, the use of the OpenBSD
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a>
shell is assumed.

<p>
<li><b>Stop any appropriate applications:</b>
During this process, all the userland applications will be replaced but
may not be runnable, and strange things may happen as a result.
If this is a concern to you, shut down any applications that may
be impacted.
There may be other applications which you wish to keep from running
immediately after the upgrade, stop and disable them as well.

<p>
<li><b>Check the kernel:</b>
Although <b>most people can skip this step</b>, if you had a modified kernel
in 4.9, it is likely you will need to modify the stock kernel of 5.0.
Especially when you are performing the upgrade process remotely, now is
the time to make sure the new kernel will work upon rebooting the machine.
If any changes must be made to the kernel, the safest thing to do is to
make those changes on a local 4.9 system.
This can be as simple as modifying a specific device using config(8),
or it can involve a recompilation if the option you need is not included
in the GENERIC kernel.
Please consult <a href="faq5.html">FAQ 5 - Building the system from source</a>
before deciding to recompile your kernel.

<p>
<li><b>Install new kernel(s):</b>

<ul>
<li>If using a single processor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd bsd.mp /</b>
</pre></blockquote>
(note: you will get a harmless error message if your platform doesn't
have a bsd.mp):
<p>

<li>If you are using the multiprocessor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd.mp /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd /</b>
<b>cp bsd /bsd.sp</b>
</pre></blockquote>
</ul>

<p>
Note the extra steps for copying over the primary kernel: those are done
to ensure that there is always a valid copy of the kernel on the disk
that the system can boot from should there be a really badly timed power
outage or system crash.

<p>
<li><b>Save yourself a copy of the old reboot(1) command:</b>
You are still running the old kernel, it is possible the new reboot
command will not run on the old kernel.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cp /sbin/reboot /sbin/oreboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>Install new userland applications.</b>
<i>Do NOT install <tt>etc50.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc50.tgz</tt> now, because
that will overwrite your current configuration files!</i>
Note that we are installing base50.tgz LAST, because it will include a new
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tar.1">tar(1)</a>
utility, which may or may not run on the old kernel.
We reboot immediately, as the system is probably barely runnable now.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xserv50.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xfont50.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xshare50.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xbase50.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf game50.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf comp50.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf man50.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf base50.tgz</b> # Install last!
<b>/sbin/oreboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Not all file sets will need to be installed for all applications,
however if you installed a file set originally, you should certainly
upgrade it with the new file set now.

<p>
Again, the files in <tt>/etc</tt> are handled separately below, so
<tt>etc50.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc50.tgz</tt> are NOT unpacked here.

<p>
<li><b>After reboot completes, upgrade <tt>/dev</tt>.</b>
The new
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-5.0/i386/MAKEDEV">MAKEDEV</a>
file was copied to /dev by the installation of
<tt>base50.tgz</tt>, so you simply need to do the following:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /dev</b>
<b>./MAKEDEV all</b>
</pre></blockquote>

</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="final">Final steps</h2>

Whether you upgrade by using an install kernel and doing a formal
"upgrade" process, or do a "in-place" binary upgrade, you need to update
the system configuration files which are included in the <tt>etc50.tgz</tt>
which have not been dealt with so far.
There are two processes we provide for you -- manually copying over some
files and patching others, or using the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>
process.

<p>
<h3 id="sysmerge">1a. Merging locally changed files via sysmerge(8)</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Who should use sysmerge(8):</b><br>
People running highly modified systems or systems that didn't start out
at the previous release (for example, a snapshot part way between
releases), who are upgrading to a snapshot or who have not carefully
upgraded their system in the past will find sysmerge vastly superior to
using the patches, as it works with what is actually on your system,
instead of what we expected was on your system.
It will also give you much greater control over your upgrade process,
and will involve you in it more closely.

<p>
<b>Who may wish to NOT use sysmerge(8):</b><br>
With recent improvements in sysmerge, we hope that relatively few
people have reason not to use sysmerge(8)!
However, people with a large quantity of similar machines to upgrade
may find the "patchfile" process faster, and perhaps the basis of
a customized upgrade script.

<p>
<b>Using sysmerge(8) for the first time:</b><br>
If you have a system that's been upgraded in the past via the patchfile
process you will probably find the FIRST time you upgrade by sysmerge,
you have a LOT of manual file changes to make.
This is because the patch file process only attempted to achieve
functional compatibility on the upgraded system, and did not respect
the version control information sysmerge(8) uses to identify "unchanged"
files.
Rest assured, later runs of sysmerge will be far less painful, and often
completely effortless.

<p>
The
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>
utility will compare the files that are actually on your system with
those that would be installed in a fresh install, and assist you in
merging the changes into your system.
Note that unlike the patch file, there are no assumptions made about
what is actually on your system, so you can use sysmerge(8) to move
between more arbitrary <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">points in the
development process</a>, such as from an earlier <i>4.9-current</i> to
<i>5.0-release</i> or from one <i>-current</i> to a later one.
Sysmerge(8) compares the current files on your system with the files
that would have been installed with a new install, and what would have
been there from the last run of sysmerge.
Usually, it can figure out what to do to update your files, but if it
has difficulty, it will give you the option of keeping the old file,
installing the new file, or assisting you in the manual merging of the
old and new files, using
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff</a>.

<p>
Please read the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>
manual page before using it on your system.
You are also advised to read the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/diff.1">diff(1)</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff(1)</a>
and even review
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/more.1">more(1)</a>
manual pages before continuing.

<p>
Assuming the <tt>etc50.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc50.tgz</tt> files exists in
your $RELEASEPATH, run it with:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>sysmerge -s $RELEASEPATH/etc50.tgz -x $RELEASEPATH/xetc50.tgz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

For the files sysmerge(8) can't resolve on its own, it will show you a
unified
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/diff.1">diff(1)</a>,
run through your favorite $PAGER (i.e.,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/more.1">more(1)</a>)
and ask you if you wish to:
<blockquote><pre>
  Use 'd' to delete the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'i' to install the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'm' to merge the temporary and installed versions
  Use 'v' to view the diff results again

  Default is to leave the temporary file to deal with by hand
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you wish to retain your existing file, delete the temporary file, if
you wish to replace your existing file with the new version, install the
temporary file.
If you wish to merge the two together, choosing 'm' will put you into
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff(1)</a>,
where you can manually merge the file.
The default is to come back and deal with the file later, manually.

<p>
Sysmerge(8) saves all your replaced files into a temporary directory,
similar to <tt>/var/tmp/sysmerge.24959/backups</tt>, so if you accidentally
clobber something that was probably not such a good idea, you have a chance
to recover it. Note that
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/daily.8">daily(8)</a>
cleans old files from this directory.

<p>
<b>Sysmerge notes for 4.9 -> 5.0:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b><tt>/etc/dhclient.conf</tt>:</b> Due to changes in the default, you will be
presented with <tt>dhclient.conf</tt> as a file to deal with in sysmerge.
Most users will want to simply <i>delete</i> the proposed replacement file
and stick with your current dhclient.conf file.

<li><b><tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.subr</tt>:</b>
You will almost certainly want to <i>install</i> the new <tt>rc.subr</tt>
file.

<li><b><tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>:</b>
The changes to <tt>sysctl.conf</tt> are all commented out items, so
installing the changed file will not directly change your system
behavior.
Blindly installing the new default over your old, customized file
will often cause significant annoyance.
However, the new file shows the defaults and common options that are
available, so you may wish to manually merge the changes into your file,
or install the new file and put your changes back into the new file.

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
<h3 id="patchfile">1b. Merging locally changed files via a patch file</h3>
<blockquote>
This process makes a lot of assumptions about what files you have and
have not modified, and that you are upgrading from <i>4.9-release</i> to
<i>5.0-release</i>.
Before following this, make sure your system matches the assumptions,
and alter the process accordingly if needed -- or just use the above
<a href="#sysmerge">sysmerge process</a>.

<p id="UsersGroups">
No new users and groups need to be created for 5.0.
<!--
The following users need to be created for 4.8:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>useradd -u 99 -g =uid -c "sndio privsep" -d /var/empty -s /sbin/nologin _sndio
useradd -u 100 -g =uid -c "LDAP Daemon" -d /var/empty -s /sbin/nologin _ldapd
useradd -u 101 -g =uid -c "IKEv2 Daemon" -d /var/empty -s /sbin/nologin _iked</b>
</pre></blockquote>
-->

<p>
You will want to extract the <tt>etc50.tgz</tt> files to a temporary
location:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=/usr/rel</b>
<b>tar -C /tmp -xzphf ${RELEASEPATH}/etc50.tgz</b>
</pre></blockquote>


Files that can probably be copied from <tt>etc50.tgz</tt> "as is":

<blockquote><pre>
etc/daily
etc/lynx.cfg
etc/ksh.kshrc
etc/netstart
etc/rc
etc/rc.conf
etc/weekly
etc/ypldap.conf
etc/rc.d/*
etc/mail/localhost.cf
etc/mail/sendmail.cf
etc/mail/submit.cf
var/named/etc/root.hint
</pre></blockquote>

Note that it IS possible to locally modify these files; if this has been
done, do NOT simply copy over those files, and consider using the
<a href="#sysmerge">sysmerge(8) process</a> instead.
Pay special attention to <tt>mail/*</tt> if you are using something
other than the default Sendmail(8) configuration.

<p>
These two files should be reworked to use the <tt>rc.d</tt> startup
and shutdown process, but the details will vary considerably.
We suggest you save a copy of your old files, copy over the new ones,
and manually verify that all things that were being started and stopped
in these files:
<blockquote><pre>
etc/rc.local
etc/rc.shutdown
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Here are copy/paste lines for copying these files, assuming you unpacked
<tt>etc50.tgz</tt> in the above recommended place:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /tmp/etc
mv /etc/rc.local /etc/rc.local.o
mv /etc/rc.shutdown /etc/rc.shutdown.o
cp daily lynx.cfg ksh.kshrc netstart rc rc.conf rc.local rc.shutdown weekly ypldap.conf /etc/
cp rc.d/* /etc/rc.d/
cp ../var/named/etc/root.hint /var/named/etc/
cp mail/*.cf /etc/mail/</b> # Use with care!
</pre></blockquote>
<p>


<p>
These files likely have local changes, but should be updated for
5.0.  IF you have not altered these files, you can copy over the
new version, otherwise the changes should be merged with your files:

<blockquote><pre>
etc/changelist
etc/login.conf
etc/man.conf
etc/newsyslog.conf
etc/sysctl.conf
</pre></blockquote>

The changes to these files are in <a href="upgrade50.patch">this
patch file</a>.
Please test this process before relying on it for a machine you can not
easily get to.
You can attempt to use this by executing the following as root:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /</b>
<b>patch -C -p0 &lt; upgrade50.patch</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will test the patch to see how well it will apply to YOUR system;
to actually apply it, leave off the "<tt>-C</tt>" option.
Note that it is likely that if you have customized files or not kept
them closely updated, or are upgrading from a snapshot of 4.9, they may
not accept the patch cleanly.
Make sure all file changes are attempted; patch(1) may quit prematurely
if it gets too confused in one file, which may happen if your machine
was originally installed from a snapshot or otherwise has some interim
changes.
The last file to be changed here should be <tt>sysctl.conf</tt>.
Deleting the file sections that fail from the patch file may permit the
rest to be applied.
You will need to manually apply the changes that are skipped.

<p>
The following files have had changes which should be looked at, but it
is unlikely they should be directly copied or merged (i.e., if you are
using pf.conf, look at the suggested change of strategy, and decide if
it is appropriate for your use).

<blockquote><pre>
etc/pf.conf
etc/relayd.conf
etc/remote
etc/ssh/sshd_config
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

Finally, use
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/newaliases.8">newaliases(8)</a>
to update the aliases database,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mtree.8">mtree(8)</a>

<h3>3. Checking the kernel</h3>
Note: <b>most people can skip this step!</b>
<p>
If you followed the instructions for the upgrade process without install
kernel, you have already completed this step.
However, if you used the install kernel, and if you had a modified kernel
in 4.9, it is likely you will need to modify the stock kernel of 5.0.
This can be as simple as modifying a specific device using config(8),
or it can involve a recompilation if the option you need is not included
in the GENERIC kernel.
Please consult <a href="faq5.html">FAQ 5 - Building the system from source</a>
before considering to recompile your kernel.

<h3>4. Upgrading packages</h3>
If you installed any packages on your system, you should upgrade them
after completing the upgrade of the base system.
Be aware, however, many packages will require further setup before
and/or after upgrading the package.
Check with the application's upgrade guide for details.

<p>
The following packages are known to have significant upgrade issues that
will impact a large number of users.
The fact that a package is not on this list doesn't mean it will have a
trivial upgrade.
You must do some homework on the applications YOU use.

<ul>
<li><b>kqemu:</b> Must be kept in sync with the kernel. pkg_delete prior
to the upgrade, then pkg_add the new package once the upgrade has been
completed.

<p>
<li><b>SOGo update:</b>
SOGo has been updated to 1.3.6.
The new session handling requires a new configuration default named
OCSSessionsFolderURL.
For more information consult the package README file or the general
SOGo Installation Guide installed with the package.

<p>
<li><b>www/opera-flashplugin removed:</b>
www/opera-flashplugin has been removed. You can install GNU Gnash as a
replacement.

<p>
<li><b>Dovecot update:</b>
Dovecot has had a major update, needing some changes in configuration files.
The dovecot.conf configuration file has moved from /etc to /etc/dovecot.
See the <a href="https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Upgrading/2.0">notes on upgrading
from 1.1 to 2.0</a> on Dovecot's wiki for more information about how to handle
this.<p>
The database support has been moved from flavoured versions of Dovecot
(dovecot-1.2.16p5-ldap, -mysql, -postgresql, -sqlite, etc) to plugins
in subpackages (dovecot-ldap-2.0.13, etc).
All older versions will be upgraded to the new main package; if you're
using a flavoured version for database support, you will need to add the
relevant subpackage/s yourself.
Berkeley DB is no longer supported, if you're using this you will need
to switch to a SQL database instead.

<p>
<li><b>pstoraster moved to its own package:</b>
The pstoraster print filter has moved out of ghostscript into the
gstoraster package. If you use a CUPS print filter that requires pstoraster
to run, you need to install the new package manually:
<blockquote><pre><b># pkg_add gstoraster
</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>PHP: support for multiple versions:</b>
Multiple PHP versions are now supported in packages.
<br>

<i>php.ini moved</i><br>
The directory layout of the PHP port has been adjusted.
/var/www/conf/php.ini has been replaced by /etc/php-$VERSION.ini.
If you have made changes to /var/www/conf/php.ini file, make sure
they are carried across to the relevant file for whichever version
you will be running (/etc/php-5.2.ini or /etc/php-5.3.ini).
<br><br>

<i>php5.conf renamed to php-5.2.conf</i><br>
If you are currently using PHP with the web server in base, you will
need to adjust your configuration:
<blockquote><pre><b>cd /var/www/conf/modules
rm php5.conf
ln -s /var/www/conf/modules.sample/php-5.2.conf /var/www/conf/modules/php.conf
</b></pre></blockquote>

<i>php module changes</i><br>
The various PHP modules (for example gd, mysql, postgresql, xcache,
and various other modules which are part of PHP or from PECL) had their
configuration files in /var/www/conf/php5.sample; symbolic links for
active modules were placed in /var/www/conf/php5.
These have moved to /etc/php-5.2.sample and /etc/php-5.2 respectively.
You will need to check for existing links in /var/www/conf/php5 and
create equivalent links in /etc/php-5.2.
Note that mbstring is now part of the main php-5.2 package so an
existing mbstring.ini symbolic link can be ignored.

<p>
<li><b>Change in startup procedure for Postfix and exim:</b>
The base OS has moved to using scripts in /etc/rc.d to start all daemons.
The script for sendmail does not function fully for alternative MTAs (in
particular it will display "failed" at startup, although the daemon will
still be started, and "/etc/rc.d/sendmail reload" or "...stop" will not
work as expected).
If you were using Postfix or exim and starting it using the standard
method of setting sendmail_flags in rc.conf.local, you should set
sendmail_flags=NO and start the relevant daemon via pkg_scripts,
e.g.
<blockquote><pre><b>pkg_scripts="${pkg_scripts} postfix"
</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>Amavisd-new update:</b>
Amavisd-new has had a major update, needing some changes in sql schema.
See the notes on <a href="https://amavis.org/release-notes.txt">upgrading from 2.6 to 2.7</a>
on Amavisd-new's web site for more information about how to handle this.

<p>
<li><b>pecl-imagick needs pthread</b>
ImageMagick has been updated to a version which now requires threads support.<p>
Due to the current userland threading mechanism in OpenBSD it is necessary
that programs calling libraries needing threads do themselves load the thread
library to ensure that i/o wrapper functions are used.<p>
This can be done by linking the programs with the -pthread compiler flag,
which is commonly done in ports, but can't always be done so sometimes
extra configuration is needed - common examples are Perl and httpd in the
base OS.<p>
The typical symptom is a failure of the program to start, with complaints
about missing pthread-related library functions.
In those cases you can run the program with LD_PRELOAD=libpthread.so set
in the environment which has the desired effect.
For pecl-imagick (notably required by Horde/IMP), the simplest way is to
create a login(1) class under /etc/login.conf(5) named after the
Apache rc.d(8) script, i.e. "httpd":
<blockquote><pre><b> httpd:\
	:setenv=LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpthread.so:\
	:tc=daemon:
</b></pre></blockquote>
and ensure that /etc/rc.d/httpd is used to start/restart the server
(N.B. log rotation scripts might need to be adjusted).

</ul>

<p>
The package tools support in-place updating using <tt>pkg_add -u</tt>.
For instance, to update all your packages, make sure <tt>PKG_PATH</tt> is
pointing to the 50 packages directory on your CD or nearest FTP mirror,
and use something like

<blockquote><pre>
<b>pkg_add -ui</b>
</pre></blockquote>

where the <tt>-u</tt> indicates update mode, and <tt>-i</tt> specifies
interactive mode, so pkg_add will prompt you for input when it encounters
some ambiguity. Read the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.9/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a>
manual page and the <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">package management</a>
chapter of the FAQ for more information.
