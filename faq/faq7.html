<h2 id="Keyboard">Remapping the keyboard</h2>

OpenBSD uses the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wscons">wscons(4)</a> console driver.

<p>
Most options can be controlled using the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wsconsctl">wsconsctl(8)</a> utility.
For example, to change keymappings with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wsconsctl">wsconsctl(8)</a>,
one would execute the following:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>wsconsctl keyboard.encoding=uk</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Remap <tt>[Caps Lock]</tt> to be <tt>[Control L]</tt>, the left control key:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>wsconsctl keyboard.map+="keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L"</b>
</pre></blockquote>

To make changes permanent, use the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wsconsctl.conf">wsconsctl.conf(5)</a> file.

<h2 id="ConsoleMouse">Console mouse support</h2>

For the <a href="../alpha.html">alpha</a>, <a href="../amd64.html">amd64</a>
and <a href="../i386.html">i386</a> platforms, OpenBSD provides
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wsmoused">wsmoused(8)</a>.
It can be enabled with the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rcctl">rcctl(8)</a>
utility.
See also the FAQ on the <a href="faq10.html#rc">rc script</a>.

<h2 id="Scrollback">Accessing the console scrollback buffer</h2>

On a few platforms and hardware combinations, OpenBSD provides a console
scrollback buffer.
This allows you to see information that has already scrolled past your screen.
To move up and down in the buffer, simply use the key combinations
<tt>[SHIFT]+[PGUP]</tt> and <tt>[SHIFT]+[PGDN]</tt>.
The number of pages that you can move up and view is 8.
Switching consoles will clear the scrollback buffer.

<p>
This is a feature of the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/vga">vga(4)</a> driver,
so it will not work without a VGA card, or on hardware that uses
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/drm">drm(4)</a>.

<p>
Due to space limitations, the install kernels do not provide the scrollback
function.

<h2 id="SwitchConsole">Switching consoles</h2>

On amd64, i386 and Alpha systems with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/vga">vga(4)</a>
cards, OpenBSD provides six virtual terminals by default, <tt>/dev/ttyC0</tt>
through <tt>/dev/ttyC5</tt>.
<tt>ttyC4</tt> is reserved for use by the X Window system, leaving five text
consoles available.
You can switch between them using
<tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F1]</tt>, <tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F2]</tt>,
<tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F3]</tt>, <tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F4]</tt> and
<tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F6]</tt>.

<p>
The X environment uses ttyC4, <tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F5]</tt>.
When using X, the <tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F</tt><i>n</i><tt>]</tt> keys will
take you to the text screens; <tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F5]</tt> will take you
back to the graphical environment.

<p>
If you wish to have more than the default number of virtual consoles,
use the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wsconscfg">wsconscfg(8)</a>
command to create screens for <tt>ttyC6</tt>, <tt>ttyC7</tt>
and above.
For example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>wsconscfg -t 80x25 6</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will create a virtual terminal for <tt>ttyC6</tt>, accessed by
<tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F7]</tt>.
Don't forget to add this command to your
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rc.local">rc.local(8)</a>
file if you want the extra screen the next time you boot the computer.

<p>
Note that you will not get a <tt>login:</tt> prompt on the newly created
virtual console unless you set it to "on" in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ttys">ttys(5)</a>,
and either reboot or send
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/init">init(8)</a>
a HUP signal using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/kill">kill(1)</a>.

<h2 id="Blanker">Blanking the console after a period of inactivity</h2>

If you wish to blank your console after a period of inactivity without
using X, you can alter the following
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wscons">wscons(4)</a>
variables:

<ul>
<li><b><tt>display.vblank</tt></b> set to <tt>on</tt> will disable the
vertical sync pulse, which will cause many monitors to go into an
"energy saver" mode.
This will require more time to bring the screen back on, but will reduce
energy consumption and heat production of newer monitors.
When set to <tt>off</tt>, the display will blank, but the monitor will still
be receiving the normal horizontal and vertical sync pulses, so the unblanking
will be almost instant.

<li><b><tt>display.screen_off</tt></b> determines the blanking time in
thousandths of a second, i.e., 60000 would set the timeout to one minute.

<li><b><tt>display.kbdact</tt></b> determines if keyboard activity will
restore the blanked screen.
Usually, this is desirable.

<li><b><tt>display.outact</tt></b> determines if screen output will
restore the blanked screen.
</ul>

You can set these variables at the command line using the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wsconsctl">wsconsctl(8)</a> command:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>wsconsctl display.screen_off=60000</b>
display.screen_off -> 60000
</pre></blockquote>

or set them permanently by editing
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wsconsctl.conf">wsconsctl.conf(5)</a>
so these changes take place at next boot:

<blockquote><pre>
display.vblank=on               # enable vertical sync blank
display.screen_off=600000       # set screen blank timeout to 10 minutes
display.kbdact=on               # Restore screen on keyboard input
display.outact=off              # Restore screen on display output
</pre></blockquote>

The blanker is activated when either <tt>display.kbdact</tt> or
<tt>display.outact</tt> is set to <tt>on</tt>.
Yes, one of those two must be <tt>off</tt>.

<h2 id="Size80x50">Changing console font and resolution</h2>

amd64, i386, and Alpha users with VGA but
non-<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/drm">drm(4)</a>
display adapters normally get a console screen of 25 lines of 80 characters.
However, many VGA video cards are capable of displaying a higher text
resolution of 50 lines of 80 characters.

<p>
First, a font that supports the desired resolution must be loaded using the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wsfontload">wsfontload(8)</a> command.
The standard 80x25 text screen uses 8x16 pixel fonts; to double the number
of lines we will have to use 8x8 pixel fonts.

<p>
After that, we will have to delete and recreate a <a href="#SwitchConsole">
virtual console</a> at the desired screen resolution, using the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wsconscfg">wsconscfg(8)</a> command.

<p>
This can be done automatically at boot by adding the following lines to
the end of your
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rc.local">rc.local(8)</a> file:

<blockquote><pre>
wsfontload -h 8 -e ibm /usr/share/misc/pcvtfonts/vt220l.808
wsconscfg -dF 5
wsconscfg -t 80x50 5
</pre></blockquote>

As with any modification to your system configuration, it is recommended
you spend some time with the man pages to understand what these commands do.

<p>
The first line above loads the 8x8 font.
The second line deletes screen 5 (which would be accessed by
<tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F6]</tt>).
The third line creates a new screen 5 with 50 lines of 80 characters each.
If you do this, you will see your primary screen, and the other three default
virtual consoles, come up in the standard 80x25 mode, but a new screen 5 at
80x50 accessible through <tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F6]</tt>.

<p>
Remember that <tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F1]</tt> is screen 0 (<tt>ttyC0</tt>).
If you wish to alter other screens, simply repeat the delete and add screen
steps for whichever screens you want running at the 80x50 resolution.

<p>
You should avoid changing screen 4 (<tt>ttyC4</tt>, <tt>[CTRL]+[ALT]+[F5]</tt>),
which is used by X as a graphical screen.
It is also not possible to change the resolution of the primary console
device (i.e., <tt>ttyC0</tt>).

<p>
As one might expect, all these commands can be run as root at the console.

<p>
<b>Note: this will not work on all video cards.</b>
Unfortunately, not all video cards support the uploaded fonts that
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wscons">wscons(4)</a>
requires to achieve the 80x50 text mode.
In these cases, you might wish to consider running X.
Cards supported by the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/drm">drm(4)</a>
driver will have a higher resolution anyway, but can not use these uploaded
fonts.

<h2 id="SerCon">Configuring a serial console</h2>

There are many reasons you may wish to use a serial console for your OpenBSD
system:

<ul>
  <li>Recording console output (for documentation)
  <li>Remote management
  <li>Easier maintenance of a large quantity of machines
  <li>Providing a useful dmesg from machines which might otherwise be difficult
    to get one from
  <li>Providing an accurate <tt>trace</tt> and <tt>ps</tt> output if your system
    crashes so developers can have a chance to fix the problem
</ul>

OpenBSD supports serial console on most platforms, however details vary greatly
between platforms.

<p>
Note that serial interfacing is not a trivial task -- you will often need
unusual cables, and ports are not standardized between machines, in some cases,
not even consistent on one machine.
It is assumed you know how to select the appropriate cable to go between your
computer and the device acting as your serial terminal.

<h3 id="SerContty"><tt>/etc/ttys</tt> change</h3>

There are two parts to getting a functional serial console on an OpenBSD system.
First, you must have OpenBSD use your serial port as a console for status and
single user mode.
This part is very platform-dependent.
Second, you must enable the serial port to be used as an interactive terminal,
so a user can log into it when running multi-user.
This part is fairly similar between platforms, and is detailed here.

<p>
Terminal sessions are controlled by the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ttys">ttys(5)</a> file.
Before OpenBSD will give you a <tt>login:</tt> prompt at a device, it has to be
enabled in <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>.
After all, there are uses for a serial port other than for a terminal.
In platforms which typically have an attached keyboard and screen as a console,
the serial terminal is typically disabled by default.
We'll use the i386 platform as an example.
In this case, you must edit the line that reads:

<blockquote><pre>
tty00   "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"   unknown off
</pre></blockquote>

to read something like:

<blockquote><pre>
tty00   "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"   vt220   on secure
</pre></blockquote>

Here, <tt>tty00</tt> is the serial port we are using as a console.
<tt>vt220</tt> is the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/termcap.5">termcap(5)</a>
entry that matches your terminal.
Other likely options might include <tt>vt100</tt>, <tt>xterm</tt>, etc.
The <tt>on</tt> bit activates the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/getty">getty(8)</a> for that serial port, so
that a <tt>login:</tt> prompt will be presented.
The <tt>secure</tt> bit permits a <tt>root</tt> (uid 0) login at this console.
The <tt>9600</tt> bit is the terminal baud rate.
Resist the urge to crank the baud rate up to the maximum your hardware can
support, as you are more likely to create problems than benefit.
Most systems have a <tt>default</tt> speed (supported by default by the boot ROM
and/or the boot loader, often 9600), use this unless you have real reason to use
something different.

<p>
Note that you can use a serial console for install without doing this step, as
the system is running in single user mode, and not using <tt>getty</tt> for
login.

<p>
On some platforms and some configurations, you must bring the system up in
single user mode to make this change if a serial console is all you have
available.

<h3>amd64 and i386</h3>
To direct the boot process to use the serial port as a console, create or edit
your <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/boot.conf">boot.conf(5)</a> file to include
the line

<blockquote><pre>
set tty com0
</pre></blockquote>

The default baud rate is 9600bps.
This can be changed with a <tt>/etc/boot.conf</tt> line using the <tt>stty</tt>
option.
This file is put on your boot drive, which could also be your install media, or
the command can be entered at the <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt of
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/boot">boot(8)</a> for a one-time serial console
usage.

<h4>amd64 and i386 notes:</h4>

<ul>
<li>OpenBSD numbers the serial ports starting at <i>tty00</i>,
DOS/Windows labels them starting at <i>COM1</i>.
So, keep in mind <i>tty02</i> is <i>COM3</i>, not <i>COM2</i>.

<li>Some systems may be able to operate without a video card in the
machine, but certainly not all -- many systems consider this an error
condition.
Some machines will even refuse to work easily without a keyboard attached.

<li>Some systems are capable of redirecting all BIOS keyboard and screen
activity to a serial port through a configuration option, so the machine
can be completely maintained through the serial port.
Your results may vary -- when using this feature, some BIOSs may prevent
the boot loader from seeing the serial port, and thus, the kernel will
not be told to use it.
Some BIOSs have an option to "Continue Console Redirection after POST"
(Power On Self Test), this should be set to "OFF", so the boot loader
and the kernel can handle their own console.
Unfortunately, this feature is not universal.

<li>PC-compatible computers are not designed to be run from a serial
console, unlike some other platforms.
Even those systems that support a serial console usually have it as a
BIOS configuration option -- and should the configuration information
get corrupted, you will find the system looking for a standard monitor
and keyboard again.
You generally must have some way to get a monitor and keyboard to your
amd64 and i386 systems in an emergency.

<li>You will need to edit <tt>/etc/ttys</tt> as <a href="#SerContty">above</a>.

</ul>

<h3>sparc64</h3>
These machines are designed to be completely maintainable with a serial
console.
Simply remove the keyboard from the machine, and the system will run serial.

<h4>sparc64 notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>On some systems, the serial ports are labeled <i>ttya</i>, <i>ttyb</i>,
<i>ttyh0</i> and/or <i>ttyh1</i>.

<li>Unlike some other platforms, it is not necessary to make any changes to
<tt>/etc/ttys</tt> to use a serial console.

<li>The sparc64 systems interpret a BREAK signal on the console
port to be the same as a STOP-A command, and kicks the system back to
the Forth prompt, stopping any application and operating system at that
point.
This is handy when desired, but unfortunately, some serial terminals at
power-down and some RS-232 switching devices send something the computer
interprets as a break signal, halting the machine.
Test before you go into production.

<li>If you have a keyboard and monitor attached, you can still force
the serial console to be used instead by using the following commands
at the <tt>ok</tt> prompt:

<blockquote><pre>
ok <b>setenv input-device ttya</b>
ok <b>setenv output-device ttya</b>
ok <b>reset</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If the keyboard and monitor (<tt>ttyC0</tt>) are active in <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>
(<a href="#SerContty">above</a>), you can use the keyboard and monitor in X.
</ul>

<h3>MacPPC</h3>
The MacPPC machines are configured for a serial console through OpenFirmware.
Use the commands:

<blockquote><pre>
ok <b>setenv output-device scca</b>
ok <b>setenv input-device scca</b>
ok <b>reset-all</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Set your serial console to 57600bps, 8N1.

<h4>MacPPC notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, serial console is not directly possible on most MacPPCs.
While most of these machines do have serial hardware, it isn't accessible
outside the machine.
Fortunately, a few companies offer add-on devices for several Macintosh
models which will make this port available for use as a serial console
(or other uses).
Use your favorite search engine and look for "Macintosh internal serial port."

<li>You will have to change <tt>tty00</tt> in <tt>/etc/ttys</tt> to
<tt>on</tt> and set the speed to 57600 instead of the default of 9600 as
detailed <a href="#SerContty">above</a> in single user mode before
booting multi-user and having the serial console functional.
</ul>

<h3>I get input/output error when trying to use my tty devices</h3>

You need to use <tt>/dev/cuaXX</tt> for connections initiated from the OpenBSD
system, the <tt>/dev/ttyXX</tt> devices are intended only for terminal or
dial-in usage.
While it was possible to use the tty devices in the past, the OpenBSD kernel
is no longer compatible with this usage.

<p>
From
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cua">cua(4)</a>:

<p>
For hardware terminal ports, dial-out is supported through matching
device nodes called calling units.
For instance, the terminal called <tt>/dev/tty03</tt> would have a matching
calling unit called <tt>/dev/cua03</tt>.
These two devices are normally differentiated by creating the calling unit
device node with a minor number 128 greater than the dial-in device node.
<i>Whereas the dial-in device (the tty) normally requires a
hardware signal to indicate to the system that it is active, the
dial-out device (the cua) does not, and hence can communicate unimpeded
with a device such as a modem</i>.
This means that a process like
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/getty">getty(8)</a>
will wait on a dial-in device until a connection is established.
Meanwhile, a dial-out connection can be established on the dial-out
device (for the very same hardware terminal port) without disturbing
anything else on the system.
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/getty">getty(8)</a>
process does not even notice that anything is happening on the terminal port.
If a connecting call comes in after the dial-out connection has finished, the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/getty">getty(8)</a>
process will deal with it properly, without having noticed the intervening
dial-out action.
