<a name="Intro"></a>

<i>Note: Upgrades are only supported from one release to the release
immediately following it.
Do not skip releases.
If you got lucky skipping releases in the past, you may not this time.</i>

<p><i>
It is highly recommended that you read through and fully understand
this process before attempting it.
If you are doing it on a critical or physically remote machine, it is
recommended that you test this process on an identical, local system to
verify its success before attempting on a critical or remote computer.
</i>

<p>
Note that if your browser supports Javascript, details you may not need
are hidden, but can be revealed by clicking on the links, like this one
immediately below.

<ul><li><a href="#before" onclick="javascript:flip_visibility('before')">
Before upgrading: things to think about and be aware of 
</a></ul>
<div id="before" class="visible">
This is <i>not</i> a complete list of the changes that took place
between 5.6 and 5.7, but rather some of the important things that will
impact users in the upgrade process.
For a more complete list of changes, see
<a href="../plus57.html">plus57.html</a> and the CVS change logs.

<ul>
<li><b>No etc*.tgz file sets</b><br>
<a name="NoEtc"></a>
The etcXX.tgz and xetcXX.tgz files have been merged into the base
system files.
On first install, config files will be built, but for upgrades, basic
configuration files will be untouched.
Rather than having unused config files cluttering up <tt>/etc</tt>,
example files are now stored in <tt>/etc/examples</tt>.
These samples will be blindly updated every upgrade, your configured
files will NOT be touched.

<p>
<a name="ToPorts"></a>
<li><b>Sendmail, nginx, BIND have been removed from
base</b><br>
Though these applications are all available as a packages if their use
is required.
For new installations, 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=smtpd&amp;sektion=8">smtpd(8)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=httpd&amp;sektion=8">httpd(8)</a>,

are recommended alternatives in base.

<p>

<a name="OtherChanges"></a>
<li><b>Other changes</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>rc.conf.local is no longer a shell script. Variables
	(notably pkg_scripts) must now be on single lines.
	<li>pf.conf: altq backwards compatibility has been removed.
	Remove "oldqueue" entries from pf.conf(5) if present, otherwise
	PF rules will not be loaded.
	<li>MACs, modes and ciphers permitted by sshd have been tightened.
	Some clients (notably Paramiko and old versions of PuTTY) may not
	be able connect after upgrade without sshd_config changes.
	<li>IPv6 autoconfiguration overhaul.
	Link-local addresses are no longer configured on every network
	interface by default - an explicit step to enable an IPv6 address
	must be taken in order to enable this.
	Configuring a static IPv6 address or using "rtsol" automatically
	adds the necessary link-local address so in many cases no changes
	are needed, but IPv6 pppoe(4) users must add "inet6 eui64" to
	their /etc/hostname.pppoe* files.
	<li><tt>/etc/rc</tt> and <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt> have moved from
        <tt>etc*.tgz</tt> to <tt>base57.tgz</tt>
	and <i>will</i> be replaced at upgrade time. If you have made local changes
	to these files, save a copy before upgrading.

<h2>The upgrade process</h2>

If you have access to the system's console, the easiest and safest way
to upgrade is to boot from the install kernel by boot media or
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> and follow the upgrade steps,
which are very similar to the <a href="faq4.html">install process</a>.
This is not always possible. 

<p>
Afterwards, complete the upgrade by following the <a href="#final">final
steps</a> as detailed below.
Pick one of the folowing install processes:

<p>
<ul><li><a href="#upgrade" onclick="javascript:flip_visibility('InstKern')">Upgrade
using Install Kernel (RECOMMENDED)</a>
</ul>
<div id="InstKern" class="visible">


<p>
This involves booting from the install kernel,
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a>.
This can be done by booting from an install floppy, CD, or file system image,
or you can place the 5.7 version of <tt>bsd.rd</tt> in the root of your
file system, and instructing the boot loader to boot this kernel instead
of your usual kernel (<tt>bsd</tt>).
On amd64 and i386, you do this by entering "<tt>boot bsd.rd</tt>" at the
initial <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt.

<p>
Once this kernel is booted, chose the "Upgrade" option, and follow the
prompts.
The upgrade process is very much like the installation process, though
it retains all your configuration. info.
</div>

<ul><li><a href="#upgrade" onclick="javascript:flip_visibility('NoInstKern')">Upgrade without
the Install Kernel</a>
</ul>
<div id="NoInstKern" class="visible">
<i>This is NOT the recommended process.  Use the install kernel method
if at all possible!</i>

<p>
Sometimes, one needs to do an upgrade of a machine when one can't easily
use the normal upgrade process.
The most common case is when the machine is in a remote location and you
don't have easy access to the system console.
One can usually do this by carefully following this process:

<ul>
<li><b>Place install files in a "good" location</b>.
Make sure you have sufficient space!
Running out of space on a remote upgrade could be...unfortunate.
Note that using softdeps can exaggerate the situation as deleted and
overwritten files do not release their space immediately.
Having at least 200MB free on /usr would be recommended.

<p>
<li><b>Become root with ksh(1):</b>
While using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sudo&amp;sektion=8">sudo(8)</a>
before each command is generally a good practice, the sudo(8) command
will be broken by the last steps, so you should be root before starting
this process.
Also, the use of the OpenBSD
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ksh&amp;sektion=1">ksh(1)</a>
shell is assumed.

<p>
<li><b>Stop and/or disable any appropriate applications:</b>
During this process, all the userland applications will be replaced but
may not be runnable, and strange things may happen as a result.
You may also have issues with DNS resolution during the first reboot, so
PF rules and NFS mounts dependent upon DNS may cause boot-up problems.
There may be other applications which you wish to keep from running
immediately after the upgrade, stop and disable them as well.

<p>
<li><b>Install new boot blocks:</b>
This should actually be done at the end of any upgrade, but we will
assume this has been neglected.
Failure to do this may break serial console or other things, depending
on platform.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>installboot -v sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>Install new kernel(s):</b>
<ul>
<li>If you are using the multiprocessor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd.mp /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd /</b>
<b>cp bsd /bsd.sp</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>If using a single processor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd bsd.mp /</b>
</pre></blockquote>
(note: you will get a harmless error message if your platform doesn't
have a bsd.mp):

</ul>

<p>
Note the extra steps for copying over the primary kernel: those are done
to ensure that there is always a valid copy of the kernel on the disk
that the system can boot from should there be a really badly timed power
outage or system crash.

<p>
<li><b>Save a copy of reboot(8), install new userland applications.</b>
You are still running the old kernel, it is possible the new reboot
command will not run on the old kernel, so we will start by saving a
copy of the old reboot command.
Note that we are installing base57.tgz LAST, because it will include a new
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tar&amp;sektion=1">tar(1)</a>
utility, which may or may not run on the old kernel.
We reboot immediately, as the system is probably barely runnable after
the unpacking of all the new files.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cp /sbin/reboot /sbin/oreboot</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xserv57.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xfont57.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xshare57.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xbase57.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf game57.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf comp57.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf man57.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf base57.tgz</b> # Install last!
<b>/sbin/oreboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Not all file sets will need to be installed for all applications,
however if you installed a file set originally, you should certainly
upgrade it with the new file set now.

<p>
Again, the files in <tt>/etc</tt> are handled separately below, so
<tt>etc57.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc57.tgz</tt> are NOT unpacked here.

<p>
<li><b>After reboot completes, upgrade <tt>/dev</tt>.</b>
The new
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=MAKEDEV&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">MAKEDEV</a>
file was copied to /dev by the installation of
<tt>base57.tgz</tt>, so you simply need to do the following:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /dev</b>
<b>./MAKEDEV all</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li><b>Install the upgraded boot loader:</b>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=installboot&amp;sektion=8">installboot(8)</a>
has been "unified" across platforms, so a common (and simplified!) syntax
can be used:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>installboot -v sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>
assuming "sd0" is your boot disk.

</ul>
</div>
<hr>
<a name="final"></a>
<h2>Final steps</h2>

Whether you upgrade by using an install kernel and doing a formal
"upgrade" process, or do a "in-place" binary upgrade, you need to do a
few final steps to complete the upgrade.

<p>
<a name="sysmerge"></a>
<h3>1.
<a href="#sysmerge" onclick="javascript:flip_visibility('RunSysmerge')">
Run sysmerge(8)
</a></h3>
<div id="RunSysmerge" class="visible">
The
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysmerge&amp;sektion=8">sysmerge(8)</a>
utility will compare the files that are actually on your system with
those that would be installed in a fresh install, and assist you in
merging the changes into your system.
There are no assumptions made about
what is actually on your system, so you can use sysmerge(8) to move
between more arbitrary <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">points in the
development process</a>, such as from an earlier <i>5.6-current</i> to
<i>5.7-release</i> or from one <i>-current</i> to a later one.
Sysmerge(8) compares the current files on your system with the files
that would have been installed with a new install, and what would have
been there from the last run of sysmerge.
Usually, it can figure out what to do to update your files.
If it has difficulty, it will give you the option of keeping the old
file, installing the new file, or assisting you in the manual merging of
the old and new files, using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sdiff&amp;sektion=1">sdiff</a>.

<p>
Please read the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysmerge&amp;sektion=8">sysmerge(8)</a>
manual page before using it on your system.
You are also advised to read the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1">diff(1)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sdiff&amp;sektion=1">sdiff(1)</a>
and even review
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=more&amp;sektion=1">more(1)</a>
manual pages before continuing.
A wide terminal window (i.e., significantly more than 80 characters), if
available, will make sdiff(1) easier to use.

<p>
Sysmerge(8) is run simply by invoking it as root:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>sysmerge</b>
</pre></blockquote>

For the files sysmerge(8) can't resolve on its own, it will show you a
unified
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1">diff(1)</a>,
run through your favorite $PAGER (i.e.,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=more&amp;sektion=1">more(1)</a>)
and ask you if you wish to:
<blockquote><pre>
  Use 'd' to delete the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'i' to install the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'm' to merge the temporary and installed versions
  Use 'v' to view the diff results again

  Default is to leave the temporary file to deal with by hand
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you wish to retain your existing file, delete the temporary file.
If you wish to replace your existing file with the new version, install the
temporary file.
If you wish to merge the two together, choosing 'm' will put you into
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sdiff&amp;sektion=1">sdiff(1)</a>,
where you can manually merge the file.
The default is to come back and deal with the file later, manually.

<p>
Sysmerge(8) saves all your replaced files into a temporary directory,
similar to <tt>/var/tmp/sysmerge.24959/backups</tt>, so if you accidentally
clobber something that was probably not such a good idea, you have a chance
to recover it. Note that
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=daily&amp;sektion=8">daily(8)</a>
cleans old files from this directory, but it will survive a reboot.
</div>

<a name="RmFiles"></a>
<h3>2.
Files to delete and move
</h3>
Some files should be deleted from your system, and others
must be moved or updated.
Note that some of these may not exist on all systems; that's ok.
The list of commands to run is broken up into modest size blocks; some
slower hardware will have trouble keeping up with one large copy/paste.

The following files are associated with httpd(8) and can be deleted in some
cases, but may have been replaced with user content or configuration.
<b>Warning: On systems which currently or have previously used any http daemon,
care must be taken and files analyzed case by case to avoid accidental deletion
of user content or important configuration files.</b>
In particular, users moving to the apache-httpd-openbsd package will want to
keep many of these files.

Sendmail has been removed from the base OS, but is available as a package
in 5.7.
The standard MTA is now
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=smtpd&amp;sektion=8">smtpd(8)</a>.
To switch to smtpd, make sure that no important mail is waiting in Sendmail's
queue, remove the sendmail crontab entry from root's crontab, edit
<tt>/etc/mailer.conf</tt> to make sure only smtpd is run, and run newaliases.


<p>
<a name="Pkgup"></a>
<h3>3. Upgrading packages</h3>
If you installed any packages on your system, you should upgrade them
after completing the upgrade of the base system.
Be aware, however, many packages will require further setup before
and/or after upgrading the package.
Check with the application's upgrade guide for details.

<ul><li><p><a href="#Pkgup" onclick="javascript:flip_visibility('PkgTips')">Package Upgrade Tips</a>
</ul>
<div id="PkgTips" class="visible">
<p>
The following packages are known to have significant upgrade issues that
will impact users.
The fact that a package is not on this list doesn't mean it will have a
trivial upgrade.
You must do some homework on the applications YOU use.

<ul>
<li><b>BIND has moved to packages.</b><br>
Using the base system's
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nsd&amp;sektion=8">nsd(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=unbound&amp;sektion=8">unbound(8)</a>
is recommended, but BIND is still available as a package.
Note that while BIND has both the authoritative and resolving features
in one program, the functions are separate for nsd and unbound.
An example configuration might be to have nsd running on localhost, and
unbound running on an exposed address, and unbound forwarding locally
defined names to nsd for authoritative information.

<li><b>nginx has been moved to ports</b><br>
nginx has been removed in favor of OpenBSD's own
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=httpd&amp;sektion=8">httpd(8)</a>.

<p>
<li><b>puppetdb split single config file into multiple files</b><br>
With puppetdb-2.1.0p1 the single puppetdb.ini file was split into
multiple .ini files.
The configuration needs to be adapted after upgrade.
More information in the puppetdb package README.

<p>
<li><b>collectd updated to 5.4.1</b><br>
<tt>sysutils/collectd</tt> has been updated to version 5.4.1, users of
previous 4.10.1 version should review this
<a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/V4_to_v5_migration_guide">upgrade guide</a>
to migrate their existing setups.

<p>
<li><b>symon package split</b><br>
The split between subpackages for symon has been adjusted.
Depending on which subpackage you installed previously, you may lose
the "symux" monitor after a pkg_add -u, if so, just run "pkg_add symux".

<p>
<li><b>php version bump</b><br>
The default version of PHP has been switched to 5.5.
After updating to new packages when they are available, you will need
to move the configuration across from 5.4.
Check for local changes in /etc/php-5.4.ini and apply them to php-5.5.ini,
and create new symbolic links for any required extensions in /etc/php-5.5.
For the common case where you would like to keep existing extensions
you can do this:
<pre>
	cd /etc/php-5.4
	for i in *; do ln -s ../php-5.5.sample/$i ../php-5.5/; done
</pre>
pecl-APC does not support newer PHP versions and has been retired;
xcache is still available, or you can use the new opcode cache built-in
to 5.5:
<pre>
	ln -s ../php-5.5.sample/opcache.ini /etc/php-5.5

<p>
<li><b>gnustep sudoku renamed</b><br>
Because the ports games/sudoku and x11/gnustep/sudoku used the same
package name, the gnustep one had been renamed to gnustep-sudoku.
If you have the gnustep version installed (the exact package is
currently sudoku-0.7p5), you should delete it before and re-add it
after updating installed packages, like this:

<pre>
	pkg_delete sudoku-0.7p5
	pkg_add -u
	pkg_add gnustep-sudoku
</pre>

<p>
<li><b>PostgreSQL 9.4.0</b><br>
Major update to 9.4.0. A dump/restore is required.

<p>
<li><b>wordpress 4.1</b><br>
The twentytwelve theme from wordpress 4.0.x is no longer included with
wordpress 4.1.x. If you are using this theme, back it up before updating:
<pre>
	cd /var/www/wordpress/wp-content/themes &&
	cp -Rp twentytwelve twentytwelve.bak
</pre>
and restore it after wordpress update:
<pre>
	cd /var/www/wordpress/wp-content/themes &&
	mv twentytwelve.bak twentytwelve
</pre>

<p>
<li><b>MySQL replaced with MariaDB</b><br>
MySQL has been replaced with the MariaDB fork.
The changeover should be straightforward and package updates will be handled
by <tt>pkg_add -u</tt>, but there are a couple of additional steps to take:
<ul>
<li>Before upgrading to OpenBSD 5.7, run <tt>mysqladmin flush-logs</tt> to simplify recovery in case of problems
<li>After upgrading, run <tt>mysql_upgrade</tt> to upgrade system tables
<li>Replace "skip-locking" in /etc/my.cnf with "skip-external-locking"
</ul>

Note that replication between MySQL 5.1.x and MariaDB 10.x should work,
but is not a supported configuration.

<p>
<li><b>rc script name changes</b><br>
The rc scripts for some ports have changed their name to better match
the original upstream names and/or binary name:
<ul>
  <li><tt>dbus_daemon</tt> &#8594; <tt>messagebus</tt></li>
  <li><tt>puppetmasterd</tt> &#8594; <tt>puppetmaster</tt></li>
  <li><tt>puppetd</tt> &#8594; <tt>puppet</tt></li>
</ul>
Modify <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> accordingly.
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The package tools support in-place updating using <tt>pkg_add -u</tt>.
For instance, to update all your packages, make sure <tt>PKG_PATH</tt> is
pointing to the 5.7 packages directory on your CD or nearest FTP mirror,
and use something like

<blockquote><pre>
<b>pkg_add -u</b>
</pre></blockquote>

where the <tt>-u</tt> indicates update mode;
pkg_add will prompt you for input when it encounters
some ambiguity.
Read the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pkg_add&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+5.7">pkg_add(1)</a>
manual page and the <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">package management</a>
chapter of the FAQ for more information.
