<h2 id="LostPW">8.1 - I forgot my root password</h2>

The basic process to regain root is to boot into single user mode, mount
the relevant partitions (<tt>/</tt> and <tt>/usr</tt>), run
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=passwd">passwd(1)</a>
to change the root password.
You can then boot and login normally.

<p>
The detailed process:
<ul>
<li><b>Boot into single user mode.</b>
This part of the process varies from <a href="../plat.html">platform</a>
to platform.
For amd64 and i386 platforms, the <a href="faq14.html#Boot386">second stage
boot loader</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;arch=i386">
boot(8)</a>, pauses for a few seconds to give you a chance to provide
parameters to the kernel.
This prompt looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
probing: pc0 com0 com1 apm mem[636k 190M a20=on]
disk: fd0 hd0+
>> OpenBSD/i386 BOOT 3.26
boot>
</pre></blockquote>

At this point, enter <tt>boot -s</tt> to bring the system up in single
user mode:

<blockquote><pre>
boot> <b>boot -s</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Most other platforms send parameters to the kernel via the boot ROM.

<p>
Of course the problem before this will probably be getting the system to
shut down.
Most likely, this will involve hitting the reset button or the power button.
While hardly desirable, there usually isn't any alternative.
Don't worry too much, OpenBSD's file system is very robust.

<li><b>Mount the partitions.</b>
Both <tt>/</tt> and <tt>/usr</tt> will need to be mounted read-write.
Assuming they are on separate partitions (as they should be), the following
will work:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fsck -p / &amp;&amp; mount -uw /</b>
# <b>fsck -p /usr &amp;&amp; mount /usr</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li><b>Run <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=passwd">
passwd(1)</a> to change the root password.</b>
As you already have root privileges (from being in single-user mode), it
will not ask you to provide your current password.

<li><b>boot into multiuser mode.</b>
This can be done by either entering "CTRL-D" to resume the normal boot process,
or by entering the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=reboot">reboot(8)</a>
command.

</ul>

If this is a non-personal machine, you should probably use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=doas">doas(1)</a>
to give multiple (trusted) people the ability to execute root commands.

<p>
<b>"Wait.  That looked too easy!  That isn't very secure!"</b>
If an attacker has physical access to your system, they win, regardless of the
OS on the computer.
There are ways to force the use of a password on single-user mode, see
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ttys">ttys(5)</a>,
or eliminate the pause on i386/amd64, see
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot.conf&amp;arch=i386">
boot.conf(8)</a>.
Getting around those tricks is also pretty easy.
One way would be to boot from a CD or USB drive and edit (or replace) the 
password file.
You can try to prevent that, but then someone will pull the hard disk out of
your computer.
Making your computer difficult to manage properly isn't real security,
and if you don't have the physical machine secured, you have no real security.

<p>
Note: many "remote management" systems give most of the functionality of
physical access to the computer, and that needs to be considered.
Don't tell yourself the system is secure if there is a way for an attacker
to grab console, insert a virtual floppy and force a reboot of the machine.
They might as well have physical access to the system.
The console management system is likely not as secure as OpenBSD...

<h2 id="X">8.2 - X won't start, I get lots of error messages</h2>

A common cause for X problems is the machdep.allowaperture
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl">sysctl(8)</a>
setting.
Since this defaults to being disabled on OpenBSD, this is a fairly likely
cause of the problem.

<p>
You need to edit <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt> and set
<b>machdep.allowaperture=2</b> (or <b>1</b>, depending upon your platform).
This will allow X to access the aperture driver,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xf86">xf86(4)</a>,
upon the next reboot.
It can not be made available after boot.
This can also be set during install if you answer "Y" when you are asked
whether you expect to run the X Window System.

<p>
OpenBSD requires that the aperture driver be activated on alpha, amd64, i386,
macppc and sparc64 platforms to control access to the video boards.
Other platforms use a safer way to handle the video system, and do not
need this (and do not have it in their kernel).
If you do not anticipate using X on your system, it is recommended that
you not enable the aperture driver.

<p>
For more information about configuring and using X on your platform, see
the <tt>/usr/X11R6/README</tt> file on your installed system.

<h2 id="Programming">8.3 - Can I use programming language "L" on OpenBSD?</h2>

You will find support for many common programming languages either
in the base system (more specifically in the <tt>baseXX.tgz</tt> and
<tt>compXX.tgz</tt> file sets), or in the
<a href="faq15.html">packages and ports system</a>.
It is recommended that you install the required file set or package
containing the specific compiler you want to use, instead of building it
from source.
For some compilers, building from source requires a lot of system
resources and is often unneeded unless you have specific needs or
there is <a href="faq15.html#NoPkg">no package available</a>.

<p>
The following table attempts to give an overview of compilers for different
languages, where you can find them, and whether there are any issues or
limitations with them.
Some of these are limited to certain platforms.
This can be seen either by examining a
<a href="faq15.html#PortsSearch">search result</a> through the ports tree,
and noting what is mentioned in "Archs", or by inspecting the port's
Makefile directly.
In the latter case, look for lines containing <tt>ONLY_FOR_ARCHS</tt>,
<tt>NOT_FOR_ARCHS</tt>, <tt>BROKEN</tt>, etc.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> For ease of use, this article provides an alphabetical list,
without distinguishing between different categories of programming languages.
This is not a comprehensive list of everything that is available or can
be used on OpenBSD.
If you feel there are inaccuracies or issues which are not mentioned here,
feel free to <a href="../report.html">report</a> that.

<h3>Other development tools</h3>

Additionally, there are many other development tools available within the base
system or as packages or ports.
A few examples:
<ul>
<li>Unix shells: ksh and csh in the base system, many others (e.g. zsh, tcsh)
in the <tt>shells</tt> subdirectory of the ports tree.
<li>"make" utilities: the traditional BSD
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=make">make(1)</a>
program is in the base system, and the ports tree contains other flavors
which are required to compile some software.
<li>Graphical toolkits: many popular graphical toolkits (e.g. GTK+, Tk, Qt,
wxWidgets, ...) have been ported to OpenBSD.
They can be found in the <tt>x11</tt> subdirectory of the ports tree.
<li>Version control systems: GNU CVS as used by the OpenBSD project is in
the base system, and the ports tree contains a few others (git, subversion,
mercurial, bazaar, fossil, ...).
</ul>

<h2 id="Ports">8.4 - What is the ports tree?</h2>
Please see <a href="faq15.html#Ports">FAQ 15's ports section</a>.

<h2 id="Packages">8.5 - What are packages?</h2>
Please see <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">FAQ 15's packages section</a>.

<h2 id="PortsvsPkgs">8.6 - Should I use Ports or Packages?</h2>
This is also covered in <a href="faq15.html#Intro">FAQ 15</a>.

<h2 id="NoFloppy">8.8 -  Is there any way to use my floppy drive if it's not
attached during boot?</h2>

You need to set the kernel to always assume the floppy is attached, even
if not detected during the hardware probe, by setting the 0x20 flag bit
on
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdc">fdc(4)</a>.

This can be done by using <a href="faq5.html#BootConfig">User Kernel Config</a>
or <a href="faq5.html#config">config(8)</a> to alter your kernel,

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>config -e -f /bsd</b>
OpenBSD 5.8 (GENERIC) #1066: Sun Aug 16 02:33:00 MDT 2015
    deraadt@i386.openbsd.org:/usr/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/GENERIC
Enter 'help' for information
ukc> <b>change fd*</b>

flags [0] ? <b>0x20</b>
254 fd* changed
254 fd* at fdc0 drive -1 flags 0x20
ukc> <b>q</b>
Saving modified kernel.
#
</pre></blockquote> <!-- XXXrelease - replace version string -->

<h2 id="Bootloader">8.9 - OpenBSD's bootloader (i386, amd64)</h2>

When booting your OpenBSD system, you have probably noticed the boot prompt.

<blockquote><pre>
boot>
</pre></blockquote>

For most people, you won't have to do anything here.
It will automatically boot if no commands are given.
But sometimes problems arise, or special functions are needed.
That's where these options will come in handy.
To start off, you should read through the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;arch=i386">
boot(8)</a>
man page.
Here we will go over the most common used commands for the bootloader.

<p>
To start off, if no commands are issued, the bootloader will
automatically try to boot <tt>/bsd</tt>.
If that fails, it will try <tt>/obsd</tt>, and if that fails, it will try
<tt>/bsd.old</tt>.
You can specify a kernel by hand by typing:

<blockquote><pre>
boot> <b>boot hd0a:/bsd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

or

<blockquote><pre>
boot> <b>b /bsd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will boot the kernel named <tt>bsd</tt> from the 'a' partition of
the first BIOS recognized hard disk.

<p>
Here is a brief list of options you can use with the OpenBSD kernel.
<ul>
  <li><tt>-a</tt>:
    This will allow you to specify an alternate root device after booting
    the kernel.
  <li><tt>-c</tt>:
    This allows you to enter the boot time configuration.
    Check the <a href="faq5.html#BootConfig">Boot Time Config</a> section
    of the FAQ.
  <li><tt>-s</tt>:
    This is the option to boot into single user mode.
  <li><tt>-d</tt>:
    This option is used to dump the kernel into ddb.
    Keep in mind that you must have DDB built into the kernel.
</ul>

<p>
These are entered in the format of: <b>boot [ image [-acds]]</b>

<p>
For further reading you can read
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;arch=i386">
boot(8)</a>.

<h2 id="SKey">8.10 - S/Key</h2>

S/Key is a ``one-time password'' authentication system.
It can be useful for people who don't have the ability to use an encrypted
channel which protects their authentication credentials in transit, as can
be established using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh">ssh(1)</a>.

<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>
One-time password systems only protect authentication information.
They do not prevent network eavesdroppers from gaining access to private
information.
Furthermore, if you are accessing a secure system A, it is recommended that
you do this from another trusted system B, to ensure nobody is gaining access
to system A by logging your keystrokes or by capturing and/or forging input
and output on your terminal devices.

<p>
The S/Key system generates a sequence of one-time (single use) passwords
from a user's <b>secret passphrase</b> along with a challenge received from
the server, by means of a secure <b>hash function</b>.
The system is only secure if the secret passphrase is never transferred
over the network.
Therefore <b>initializing or changing your secret passphrase MUST be done
over a secure channel</b>, such as
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh">ssh(1)</a>
or the console.

<p>
OpenBSD's S/Key implementation can use a variety of algorithms as the
one-way hash function.
The following algorithms are available:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=md5">md5</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sha1">sha1</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rmd160">rmd160</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Setting up S/Key - The first steps </h3>

To start off, the directory <tt>/etc/skey</tt> must exist.
If this directory doesn't exist, have the superuser create it.
This can be done simply by doing:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>skeyinit -E</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Once that directory is in existence, you can initialize your S/Key.
To do this, you must use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skeyinit">skeyinit(1)</a>.
Since skeyinit(1) will be asking you for your S/Key secret passphrase,
you must run this <b>over a secure channel</b>, as explained above!
The program will even remind you of this.
With skeyinit(1), you will first be prompted for your password to the
system.
This is the same password that you used to log into the system.
Once you have authorized yourself with your system password, you will be
asked for your S/Key secret passphrase.
This is <b>NOT</b> your system password.
Your secret passphrase must be at least 10 characters.
We suggest using a memorable phrase containing several words as the
secret passphrase.
Here is an example user being added.


<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>skeyinit</b>
Reminder - Only use this method if you are directly connected
           or have an encrypted channel.  If you are using telnet,
           exit with no password and use skeyinit -s.
Password:
[Adding ericj with md5]
Enter new secret passphrase:
Again secret passphrase:

ID ericj skey is otp-md5 100 oshi45820
Next login password: HAUL BUS JAKE DING HOT HOG
</pre></blockquote>

One line of particular importance in here is <tt>ID ericj skey is otp-md5
100 oshi45820</tt>.
This gives a lot of information to the user.
Here is a breakdown of the sections and their importance.

<ul>
  <li><tt>otp-md5</tt>:
    This shows which one-way hash was used to create your
    One-Time Password (otp).
  <li><tt>100</tt>:
    This is your sequence number. This is a number from 100 down to 1.
    Once it reaches one, another secret passphrase must be created by running
    <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skeyinit">
    skeyinit(1)</a>.
  <li><tt>oshi45820</tt>:
    This is the key.
</ul>

<p>
But of more immediate importance is your one-time password.
Your one-time password consists of 6 small words, combined together this is
your one-time password, spaces and all.
The one-time password printed by skeyinit cannot be used to login.
There is a usage for this first one-time password, see
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skeyinit">skeyinit(1)</a>.
To be able to log in, a one-time password corresponding to the challenge printed
by the login process has to be computed using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skey">skey(1)</a>.
The next section will show how to do that.

<h3>Actually using S/Key to login.</h3>

By now your skey has been initialized.
You're ready to login.
Here is an example session using S/Key to log in.
To perform an S/Key login, you append <tt>:skey</tt> to your login name.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>ftp localhost</b>
Connected to localhost.
220 oshibana.shin.ms FTP server (Version 6.5/OpenBSD) ready.
Name (localhost:ericj): ericj:skey
331- otp-md5 96 oshi45820
331 S/Key Password:
230- OpenBSD 5.8 (GENERIC) #1066: Sun Aug 16 02:33:00 MDT 2015
230-
230- Welcome to OpenBSD: The proactively secure Unix-like operating system.
230-
230- Please use the sendbug(1) utility to report bugs in the system.
230- Before reporting a bug, please try to reproduce it with the latest
230- version of the code.  With bug reports, please try to ensure that
230- enough information to reproduce the problem is enclosed, and if a
230- known fix for it exists, include that as well.
230-
230 User ericj logged in.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp&gt; quit
221 Goodbye.
</pre></blockquote> <!-- XXXrelease - replace version strings -->

Note that <tt>:skey</tt> was appended to the username.
This tells ftpd to authenticate using S/Key.
Some of you might have noticed that the sequence number has changed to
<tt>otp-md5 96 oshi45820</tt>.
This is because by now S/Key has been used to login several times.
But how do you get your one-time password?
Well, to compute the one-time password, you'll need to know what sequence
number you're using and your key.
As you're probably thinking, how can you remember which sequence number
you're on?

<p>
When you are logging in, the login process prints a line containing
the needed information, which you can use to generate a one-time password
on the spot using another trusted computer accesses by a secure channel,
by copy-pasting the line into a command shell:

<blockquote><pre>
otp-md5 96 oshi45820
</pre></blockquote>

After typing your passphrase, your one-time password will be printed,
which you can then copy-paste to the S/Key Password prompt to log in.
Not only is <tt>otp-md5</tt> a description of the hash used, it is also
an alternate name for the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skey">skey(1)</a>
command.


<p>
If you already are logged in and want to generate a one-time password
for the next login, use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=skeyinfo">skeyinfo(1)</a>,
it will tell you what to use for the next login.
For example, the following will generate another one-time password for a login
that can be made in the future.
Remember this is being carried out from a secure channel.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>skeyinfo</b>
95 oshi45820
</pre></blockquote>

An even better way is to use <tt>skeyinfo -v</tt>, which outputs a command
suitable to be run in the shell.
For instance:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>skeyinfo -v</b>
otp-md5 95 oshi45820
</pre></blockquote>

So, the simplest way to generate the next S/Key password is just:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>`skeyinfo -v`</b>
Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet.
Enter secret passphrase:
NOOK CHUB HOYT SAC DOLE FUME
</pre></blockquote>

Note the backticks in the above example.

<p>
Many of you won't always have a secure connection or a trusted local computer
to create these passwords, and creating them over an insecure connection
isn't feasible, so how can you create multiple passwords at one time?
You can supply skey(1) with a number of how many passwords you want created.
This can then be printed out and taken with you wherever you go.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>otp-md5 -n 5 95 oshi45820</b>
Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet.
Enter secret passphrase:
91: SHIM SET LEST HANS SMUG BOOT
92: SUE ARTY YAW SEED KURD BAND
93: JOEY SOOT PHI KYLE CURT REEK
94: WIRE BOGY MESS JUDE RUNT ADD
95: NOOK CHUB HOYT SAC DOLE FUME
</pre></blockquote>

Notice here though, that the bottom password should be the first used,
because we are counting down from 100.

<h4>Using S/Key with ssh(1) and telnet(1)</h4>

Using <tt>S/Key</tt> with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh">ssh(1)</a> or
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=telnet">telnet(1)</a>
is done in pretty much the same fashion as with ftp -- you simply tack
<tt>:skey</tt> to the end of your username.
Example:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>ssh -l ericj:skey localhost</b>
otp-md5 98 oshi45821
S/Key Password: <b>SCAN OLGA BING PUB REEL COCA</b>
Last login: Thu Apr  7 12:21:48 on ttyp1 from 156.63.248.77

<h2 id="SMP">8.12 - What OpenBSD platforms support SMP?<br>
(Symmetric Multi-Processor)</h2>

SMP is supported on the
<a href="../i386.html">OpenBSD/i386</a>,
<a href="../amd64.html">OpenBSD/amd64</a>,
<a href="../mvme88k.html">OpenBSD/mvme88k</a>,
<a href="../sparc64.html">OpenBSD/sparc64</a>
(including the UltraSPARC T1/T2/T2+ processors),
<a href="../macppc.html">OpenBSD/macppc</a>,
<a href="../sgi.html">OpenBSD/sgi</a> (Octane only),
<a href="../hppa.html">OpenBSD/hppa</a>,
and
<a href="../alpha.html">OpenBSD/alpha</a>
platforms.

<p>
A separate SMP kernel, <tt>bsd.mp</tt>, is provided with the install
file sets.
If multiple processors are detected at install time, is automatically
installed as the default boot kernel, <tt>/bsd</tt>, and the single
processor kernel is renamed <tt>/bsd.sp</tt>.

<p>
If you add additional processors to a system which was installed with
only one processor, you will want to install the appropriate bsd.mp
kernel, rename your existing <tt>/bsd</tt> to <tt>/bsd.sp</tt>, and rename
<tt>/bsd.mp</tt> to <tt>/bsd</tt>.

<p>
It is hoped that other SMP-capable platforms will be supported in the future.
On most other platforms, OpenBSD will run on an SMP system, but only utilizing
one processor.
The exception to this is the <a href="../sparc.html">SPARC</a> platform --
OpenBSD/sparc will sometimes require that extra MBus modules be removed
for the system to boot.

<h2 id="TTY">8.13 - I get input/output error when trying to use my tty
devices</h2>

You need to use <tt>/dev/cuaXX</tt> for connections initiated from the OpenBSD
system, the <tt>/dev/ttyXX</tt> devices are intended only for terminal or
dial-in usage.
While it was possible to use the tty devices in the past, the OpenBSD kernel
is no longer compatible with this usage.

<p> From
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cua">cua(4)</a>:
<p>
For hardware terminal ports, dial-out is supported through matching
device nodes called calling units.
For instance, the terminal called <tt>/dev/tty03</tt> would have a matching
calling unit called <tt>/dev/cua03</tt>.
These two devices are normally differentiated by creating the calling unit
device node with a minor number 128 greater than the dial-in device node.
<i>Whereas the dial-in device (the tty) normally requires a
hardware signal to indicate to the system that it is active, the
dial-out device (the cua) does not, and hence can communicate unimpeded
with a device such as a modem</i>.
This means that a process like
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=getty">getty(8)</a>
will wait on a dial-in device until a connection is established.
Meanwhile, a dial-out connection can be established on the dial-out
device (for the very same hardware terminal port) without disturbing
anything else on the system.
The <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=getty">getty(8)</a>
process does not even notice that anything is happening on the terminal port.
If a connecting call comes in after the dial-out connection has finished, the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=getty">getty(8)</a>
process will deal with it properly, without having noticed the intervening
dial-out action.

<h2 id="Browsers">8.14 - What web browsers are available for OpenBSD? </h2>
<!-- XXXrelease - verify packages are available for each of these at
                  release time... or consider removing this list -->

The base <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp">ftp(1)</a>
utility also supports HTTP and HTTPS URLs for file downloading.
<p>
Some more advanced browsers available include (in no particular order):

<p>
<b>Graphical (X) Browsers</b>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a>
    Installed as part of the <a href="http://www.kde.org/">
    KDE desktop environment</a>.
  <li><a href="http://links.twibright.com/">Links+</a>
    Another fast and small graphical browser.

</ul>

<p>
Most of the aforementioned browsers are available as pre-compiled
<a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">packages</a> on the
<a href="../ftp.html">mirrors</a>, with some also on the
<a href="../orders.html">CD-ROM</a>.
After the installation of the <a href="#Ports">ports tree</a>, all
can also be found in the <tt>/usr/ports/www/</tt> directory.

<p>
As most of the graphical browsers are very large and require quite some time
to download and compile, one should <b>seriously</b>
<a href="#PortsvsPkgs">consider</a> the use of packages where available.

<h2 id="mg">8.15 - How do I use the mg editor?</h2>

<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mg">mg(1)</a>
is a micro Emacs-style text editor included in OpenBSD.
Micro means that it's a small implementation which is mostly
similar to the text editor features of GNU Emacs.
It does not implement many of Emacs' other features (including mail and news
functionality, as well as modes for Lisp, C++, Lex, Awk, Java, etc...).

<p>
A concise
<a href="http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/usr.bin/mg/tutorial?rev=HEAD">
tutorial</a> is included with OpenBSD
(located at <tt>/usr/share/doc/mg/tutorial</tt>).

<h2 id="ksh">8.16 - ksh(1) does not appear to read my <tt>.profile</tt></h2>

There are two likely reasons for
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ksh">ksh(1)</a>
to seemingly ignore a user's <tt>.profile</tt> file.
<ul>
<li><tt>.profile</tt> is not owned by the user.
To fix for <b>username</b>,

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>chown username ~username/.profile</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>You are using ksh(1) from within X Window System
<p>
Under <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xterm">xterm(1)</a>,
<tt>argv[0]</tt> for ksh(1) is not prepended with a dash <tt>-</tt>.
Prepending a dash to <tt>argv[0]</tt> will cause csh(1) and
ksh(1) to know they should interpret their login files.
For csh(1) that's <tt>.login</tt>, with a separate <tt>.cshrc</tt>
that is always run when csh(1) starts up.
With ksh(1), this is more noticeable because there is only one
startup script, <tt>.profile</tt>.
This file is ignored unless the shell is a login shell.
<p>
To fix this, add the line <tt>XTerm*loginShell: true</tt> to the file
<tt>.Xdefaults</tt> in your home directory.
Note, this file does not exist by default, you may have to create it.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>echo "XTerm*loginShell: true" >> ~/.Xdefaults</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You may not have had to do this on other systems, as some installations
of X Window System come with this setting as default.
OpenBSD has chosen to follow the X.org behavior.
</ul>

<h2 id="motd">8.17 - Why does my <tt>/etc/motd</tt> file get overwritten when
I modified it?</h2>

On every boot of the system, the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=motd">motd(5)</a>
file is modified by
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc">rc(8)</a>:
everything up to (but not including) the first blank line is
replaced with the version information of the active kernel.
Therefore, when editing <tt>/etc/motd</tt>, ensure that material
intended to persist across system boots is placed after the first
blank line.

<h2 id="TrueType">8.20 - Antialiased and TrueType fonts in X</h2>

See <a href="truetype.html">this document</a>.

<h2 id="Journaling">8.21 - Does OpenBSD support any journaling filesystems?</h2>

No it doesn't.
We use a different mechanism to achieve similar results called soft updates.
Please read <a href="faq14.html#SoftUpdates">FAQ 14's section on soft
updates</a> to get more details.

<h2 id="RevDNS">8.22 - Reverse DNS <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>- or -</small><br>
Why is it taking so long for me to log in?</h2>

Many new users to OpenBSD experience a two minute login delay when using
services such as
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh">ssh(1)</a> or
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp">ftp(1)</a>.
This can also be experienced when using a proxy, such as
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp-proxy">
ftp-proxy(8)</a>, or when sending mail.
<p>
This is almost always due to a reverse-DNS problem.
DNS is Domain Name Services, the system the Internet uses to convert a name,
such as "www.openbsd.org" into a numeric IP address.
Another task of DNS is the ability to take a numeric address and convert it
back to a name.
This is known as a Reverse DNS entry.
<p>
In order to provide better logging, OpenBSD performs a reverse-DNS
lookup on any machine that attaches to it in many different ways,
including
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh">ssh(1)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp">ftp(1)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp-proxy">
ftp-proxy(8)</a>.
Unfortunately, in some cases, the machine that is making the connection
does not have a proper reverse DNS entry.

<h3>An example of this situation:</h3>

A user sets up an OpenBSD box as a firewall and gateway to their
internal home network, mapping all their internal computers to one
external IP using <a href="pf/nat.html">NAT</a>.
They may also use it as an outbound mail relay.
They follow the installation guidelines, and are very happy with the results,
except for one thing -- every time they try to attach to the box in any way,
they end up with a two minute delay before things happen.

<h3>What is going on:</h3>

From a workstation behind the NAT of the gateway with an
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">unregistered IP</a>
address of 192.168.1.35, the user uses
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh">ssh(1)</a>
to access the gateway system.
The <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh">ssh(1)</a>
client prompts for username and password, and sends them to the gateway box.
The gateway then tries to figure out who is trying to log in by performing a
reverse DNS lookup of 192.168.1.35.
The problem is 192.168.0.0 addresses are for private use, so a properly
configured DNS server outside your network knows it should have no information
about those addresses.
Some will quickly return an error message.
In these cases, OpenBSD will assume there is no more information to be gained,
and it will quickly give up and just admit the user.
Other DNS servers will not return ANY response.
In this case, you will find yourself waiting for the OpenBSD name resolver to
time out, which takes about two minutes before the login will be permitted to
continue.
In the case of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp-proxy">
ftp-proxy(8)</a>, some ftp clients will timeout before the reverse DNS query times out,
leading to the impression that ftp-proxy isn't working.
<p>
This can be quite annoying.
Fortunately, it is an easy thing to fix.

<h3>Fix, using <tt>/etc/hosts</tt>:</h3>

The simplest fix is as follows:
Populate your
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts">hosts(5)</a>
file with all the workstations you have in your internal network.
Make sure that your
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=resolv.conf">
resolv.conf(5)</a> file contains the line <tt>lookup file bind</tt>.
This tells the resolver to start with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts">hosts(5)</a> file,
and failing that, to use the DNS servers specified by the <tt>nameserver</tt>
lines in your
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=resolv.conf">
resolv.conf(5)</a> file.

<p>
Your <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> file will look something like this:

<blockquote><pre>
::1 localhost.in.example.org localhost
127.0.0.1 localhost.in.example.org localhost
192.168.1.1 gw.in.example.org gw
192.168.1.20 scrappy.in.example.org scrappy
192.168.1.35 shadow.in.example.org shadow
</pre></blockquote>

Your <tt>resolv.conf</tt> file will look something like this:

<blockquote><pre>
search in.example.org
nameserver 24.2.68.33
nameserver 24.2.68.34
lookup file bind
</pre></blockquote>

A common objection to this is "But, I use DHCP for my internal network!
How can I configure my <tt>/etc/hosts</tt>?"  Rather easily, actually.
Just enter lines for all the addresses your DHCP server is going to
give out, plus any static devices:

<blockquote><pre>
::1 localhost.in.example.org localhost
127.0.0.1 localhost.in.example.org localhost
192.168.1.1 gw.in.example.org gw
192.168.1.20 scrappy.in.example.org scrappy
192.168.1.35 shadow.in.example.org shadow
192.168.1.100 d100.in.example.org d100
192.168.1.101 d101.in.example.org d101
192.168.1.102 d102.in.example.org d102
         [... snip ...]
192.168.1.198 d198.in.example.org d198
192.168.1.199 d199.in.example.org d199
</pre></blockquote>

This case assumes you have the DHCP range set to 192.168.1.100
through 192.168.1.199, plus the three static definitions as listed at
the top of the file.
<p>
If your gateway must use DHCP for configuration, you may well find you
have a problem --
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dhclient">dhclient(8)</a>
will overwrite your <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> every time the lease is
renewed, which will remove the <tt>lookup file bind</tt> line.
This can be solved by putting the line <tt>lookup file bind</tt> in the file
<tt>/etc/resolv.conf.tail</tt>.

<h3>Fix, using a local DNS server</h3>

Details on this are somewhat beyond the scope of this document, but the
basic trick is to setup your favorite DNS server, and make sure it knows
it is authoritative for both forward and reverse DNS resolution for all
nodes in your network, and make sure your computers (including your
gateway) know to use it as a DNS server.

<h2 id="wwwnotstd">8.23 - Why do the OpenBSD web pages not conform to
HTML4/XHTML?</h2>

The present web pages have been carefully crafted to work on a wide variety
of actual browsers going back to browser versions 4.0 and later.
We do not want to make these older pages conform to HTML4 or XHTML until we're
sure that they will also work with older browsers.
It's just not a priority.
We welcome new contributors, but suggest you work on writing code, or
on documenting new aspects of the system, not on tweaking the existing web

<h2 id="NTPerror">8.24 - Why is my clock off by twenty-some seconds?</h2>

When using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rdate">rdate(8)</a>
to synchronize your clock to a NTP server, you may find your clock is
off by twenty-some seconds from your local definition of time.

<p>
This is caused by a difference between the UTC (Coordinated Universal
Time, based on astronomical observations) time and TAI (International
Atomic Time, based on atomic clocks) time.
To compensate for variations in the earth's rotation, "leap seconds" are
inserted into UTC, but TAI is unadjusted.
These leap seconds are the cause of this discrepancy.
For a more detailed description, search the web for <tt>leap seconds
UTC TAI</tt>.

<p>
Addressing the problem is fairly simple.
In most countries you will get the correct time if you use the <tt>-c</tt>
parameter to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rdate">rdate(8)</a>
and use a time zone out of the directory <tt>/usr/share/zoneinfo/right</tt>.
For example, if you are located in Germany, you could use these commands:

<pre>
     # <b>cd /etc && ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/right/CET localtime</b>
     # <b>rdate -ncv ptbtime1.ptb.de</b>
</pre>

In other countries, the rules may differ.

<h2 id="TimeZone">8.25 -  Why is my clock off by several hours?</h2>

By default, OpenBSD assumes your hardware clock is set to UTC (Universal
Coordinated Time) rather than local time, assumed by some other
operating systems, which can cause problems when
<a href="faq4.html#Multibooting">multibooting</a>.

<p>
Many other operating systems, can be configured to do the
same, which avoids this problem altogether.

<p>
If having the hardware clock set to UTC is a problem, you can change the
default behavior of OpenBSD using
<a href="faq5.html#config">config(8)</a>.
For example, to configure OpenBSD to use a hardware clock set to
US/Eastern (5 hours behind UTC, so 300 minutes):

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>config -ef /bsd</b>
OpenBSD 5.8 (GENERIC) #1066: Sun Aug 16 02:33:00 MDT 2015
    deraadt@i386.openbsd.org:/usr/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/GENERIC
Enter 'help' for information
ukc> <b>timezone 300</b>
timezone = 300, dst = 0
ukc> <b>quit</b>
Saving modified kernel.
</pre></blockquote> <!-- XXXrelease - replace version strings -->

See
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=options">options(4)</a>
and search for option "TIMEZONE=value" for more information.

<p>
Normally, the time zone is set during install.
If you have need to change the time zone, you can create a new symbolic
link to the appropriate time zone file in <tt>/usr/share/zoneinfo</tt>.
For example, to set the machine to use EST5EDT as the new local time
zone:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ln -fs /usr/share/zoneinfo/EST5EDT /etc/localtime</b>
</pre></blockquote>
