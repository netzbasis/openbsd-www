<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

OpenBSD comes with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked">iked(8)</a>,
a modern, privilege-separated IKEv2 server.
It can act both as responder, e.g. a server receiving connection requests, or
initiator, e.g. a client initiating a connection to a responder.
The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ikectl">ikectl(8)</a> utility is used to
control the server, which gets its configuration from the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.conf">iked.conf(5)</a> file.

<p>
The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ikectl">ikectl(8)</a> utility also allows
you to maintain a simple X.509 certificate authority (CA) for IKEv2 peers.

<p>
An IKEv1 server (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd">isakmpd(8)</a>) is
also available and, coupled with
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/npppd">npppd(8)</a>, it allows you to build
an IKEv1/L2TP VPN where IKEv2 can't be deployed.

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked">iked(8)</a> supports the following
methods of authentication:

<ul>
  <li>pre-shared key (not recommended)
  <li>RSA &amp; ECDSA public keys: easy setup when connecting to iked, RouterOS
      and some other implementations
  <li>EAP MSCHAPv2 (with an X.509 certificate on the server side): iked supports
      this on the "responder" (server) side only
  <li>X.509 certificates: often required for Windows, Android &amp; Apple
      clients
</ul>

By default, an RSA public key is generated at boot in
<code>/etc/iked/local.pub</code>, with the private key being stored in
<code>/etc/iked/private/local.key</code>.

<h2 id="server">Configuring an IKEv2 Server</h2>

<h3 id="site2site">Building Site-to-site VPNs</h3>

This can be achieved by exchanging the default-provided RSA public keys:
<code>/etc/iked/local.pub</code> on the first system ("server1") should
be copied to <code>/etc/iked/pubkeys/fqdn/server1.domain</code> on the
second system ("server2").
Then, <code>/etc/iked/local.pub</code> on the second system should be
copied to <code>/etc/iked/pubkeys/fqdn/server2.domain</code> on the first.
Replace "serverX.domain" with your own FQDN.

<p>
From that point, let's assume that server1 has a public IP of
<code>192.0.2.1</code> and an internal network on <code>10.0.1.0/24</code>,
and that server2 has a public IP of <code>198.51.100.1</code> and an internal
network on <code>10.0.2.0/24</code>.

<p>
To enable the initiator to reach the responder, the <code>isakmp</code> UDP
port should be open on the responder.
If one of the peers is behind NAT, the <code>ipsec-nat-t</code> UDP port
should also be open on the responder.
If both peers have public IPs, then the ESP protocol should be allowed.

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in log on $ext_if proto udp from 198.51.100.1 to 192.0.2.1 port {isakmp, ipsec-nat-t} tag IKED
pass in log on $ext_if proto esp from 198.51.100.1 to 192.0.2.1 tag IKED
</pre>

An example <code>/etc/iked.conf</code> configuration for server1 (acting as
the responder) might look like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
ikev2 'server1_rsa' passive esp \
      from 10.0.1.0/24 to 10.0.2.0/24 \
      local 192.0.2.1 peer 198.51.100.1 \
      srcid server1.domain \
      rsa
</pre>

And a simple config for server2 acting as the initiator:

<pre class="cmdbox">
ikev2 'server2_rsa' active esp \
        from 10.0.2.0/24 to 10.0.1.0/24 \
        peer 192.0.2.1 \
        dstid server2.domain
</pre>

Using <code>iked -dv</code> can help you understand the exchange.
In this example, the responder is behind NAT:

<pre class="cmdbox">
server1# <b>iked -dv</b>
...
ikev2_recv: IKE_SA_INIT request from initiator 198.51.100.1:500 to 192.0.2.1:500 policy 'server1_rsa' id 0, 510 bytes
ikev2_msg_send: IKE_SA_INIT response from 192.0.2.1:500 to 198.51.100.1:500 msgid 0, 451 bytes
ikev2_recv: IKE_AUTH request from initiator 198.51.100.1:4500 to 192.0.2.1:4500 policy 'server1_rsa' id 1, 800 bytes
ikev2_msg_send: IKE_AUTH response from 192.0.2.1:4500 to 198.51.100.1:4500 msgid 1, 720 bytes, NAT-T
sa_state: VALID -> ESTABLISHED from 198.51.100.1:4500 to 192.0.2.1:4500 policy 'server1_rsa'
</pre>

On the initiator side:

<pre class="cmdbox">
server2# <b>iked -dv</b>
...
ikev2_msg_send: IKE_SA_INIT request from 0.0.0.0:500 to 192.0.2.1:500 msgid 0, 510 bytes
ikev2_recv: IKE_SA_INIT response from responder 192.0.2.1:500 to 198.51.100.1:500 policy 'server2_rsa' id 0, 451 bytes
ikev2_msg_send: IKE_AUTH request from 198.51.100.1:4500 to 192.0.2.1:4500 msgid 1, 800 bytes, NAT-T
ikev2_recv: IKE_AUTH response from responder 192.0.2.1:4500 to 198.51.100.1:4500 policy 'server2_rsa' id 1, 720 bytes
sa_state: VALID -> ESTABLISHED from 192.0.2.1:4500 to 198.51.100.1:4500 policy 'server2_rsa'
</pre>

The IPsec flows can be viewed with
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsecctl">ipsecctl(8)</a>:

<pre class="cmdbox">
server1# <b>ipsecctl -sa</b>
FLOWS:
flow esp in from 10.0.2.0/24 to 10.0.1.0/24 peer 198.51.100.1 srcid FQDN/server1.domain dstid FQDN/server2.domain type use
flow esp out from 10.0.1.0/24 to 10.0.2.0/24 peer 198.51.100.1 srcid FQDN/server1.domain dstid FQDN/server2.domain type require
flow esp out from ::/0 to ::/0 type deny

SAD:
esp tunnel from 192.0.2.1 to 198.51.100.1 spi 0xabb5968a auth hmac-sha2-256 enc aes-256
esp tunnel from 198.51.100.1 to 192.0.2.1 spi 0xb1fc90b8 auth hmac-sha2-256 enc aes-256

server2# <b>ipsecctl -sa</b>
FLOWS:
flow esp in from 10.0.1.0/24 to 10.0.2.0/24 peer 192.0.2.1 srcid FQDN/server2.domain dstid FQDN/server1.domain type use
flow esp out from 10.0.2.0/24 to 10.0.1.0/24 peer 192.0.2.1 srcid FQDN/server2.domain dstid FQDN/server1.domain type require
flow esp out from ::/0 to ::/0 type deny

SAD:
esp tunnel from 192.0.2.1 to 198.51.100.1 spi 0xabb5968a auth hmac-sha2-256 enc aes-256
esp tunnel from 198.51.100.1 to 192.0.2.1 spi 0xb1fc90b8 auth hmac-sha2-256 enc aes-256
</pre>

With that, both internal networks should be able to reach each other.
Traffic between them should appear after decapsulation on the <code>enc0</code>
interface, and can be filtered as such.
In that example, <code>tag VPN</code> has been added to the policy:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>pfctl -vvsr|grep VPN</b>
@16 pass log on enc0 tagged VPN
# <b>tcpdump -nei pflog0 rnr 16</b>
00:03:26.793522 rule 16/(match) pass in on enc0: 10.0.2.24 > 10.0.1.13: icmp: echo request
</pre>

Some words of warning:

<ul>
  <li>If the responder doesn't set <code>srcid</code>, then iked will try to
      use the key matching its FQDN by default.
  <li>The responder doesn't <b>need</b> to set <code>local</code>, it just
      ensures <code>iked</code> listens on the correct interface.
  <li>The responder doesn't <b>need</b> to set <code>peer</code>, it just
      ensures connections are coming from a trusted IP.
</ul>

If the VPN endpoints need to reach the remote internal network, or the
internal network needs to reach the remote VPN endpoint, additional flows
have to be set on both sides:

<ul>
  <li>from the local public IP to the remote network
  <li>from the internal network to the remote public IP
</ul>

The responder configuration would then look like:

<pre class="cmdbox">
ikev2 'server1_rsa' passive esp \
      from 10.0.1.0/24 to 10.0.2.0/24 \
      from 10.0.1.0/24 to 198.51.100.1 \
      from 192.0.2.1 to 10.0.2.0/24 \
      local 192.0.2.1 peer 198.51.100.1 \
      srcid server1.domain \
      rsa
</pre>

And the initiator configuration would be:

<pre class="cmdbox">
ikev2 'server2_rsa' active esp \
        from 10.0.2.0/24 to 10.0.1.0/24 \
        from 10.0.2.0/24 to 192.0.2.1 \
        from 198.51.100.1 to 10.0.1.0/24 \
        peer 192.0.2.1 \
        dstid server2.domain
</pre>

<h2 id="clientikev2">Connecting to an IKEv2 VPN</h2>

Connecting to an IKEv2 VPN as a <i>road warrior</i> is similar to the previous
case, except that the initiator usually plans to route its internet traffic
through the responder, which will apply NAT on it, so that the initiator
traffic appears to be coming from the responder's public IP.

<p>
Depending on the use case, as all traffic will go through the responder, one
must ensure the initiator is configured to use a DNS server it can reach
(possibly one on the responder).

<h3 id="clientopenbsd">With an OpenBSD Client</h3>

In our examples, the <code>10.0.5.0/24</code> network is used to support the
VPN, even if no actual network interface is configured to use an IP in this
netblock.
We'll assume the public IP for the client is <code>203.0.113.2</code>.

<p>
As with the previous example, exchanging the default-provided RSA public keys
is enough to set up a simple authentication between the responder and the
initiator: <code>/etc/iked/local.pub</code> on the first system ("server1")
should be copied to <code>/etc/iked/pubkeys/fqdn/server1.domain</code> on the
second system ("roadwarrior").
Then, <code>/etc/iked/local.pub</code> on the roadwarrior system should be
copied to <code>/etc/iked/pubkeys/fqdn/roadwarrior</code> on the first.
Replace "serverX.domain" with your own FQDN.

<p>
The responder <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.conf">iked.conf(5)</a>
creates flows from any destination to the VPN subnet and tags the packets
with ROADW:

<pre class="cmdbox">
ikev2 'responder_rsa' passive esp \
        from 0.0.0.0/0 to 10.0.5.0/24 \
        local 192.0.2.1 peer any \
        srcid server1.domain \
        tag "ROADW"
</pre>

It also needs to allow IPsec from any host (since clients might connect from
anywhere), allow traffic tagged ROADW on <code>enc0</code> and apply NAT to it:

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in log on $ext_if proto udp from any to 192.0.2.1 port {isakmp, ipsec-nat-t} tag IKED
pass in log on $ext_if proto esp from any to 192.0.2.1 tag IKED
pass log on enc0 tagged ROADW
match out log on $ext_if inet tagged ROADW nat-to $ext_if
</pre>

The initiator configures a global flow to send all its traffic to the
responder, telling it to identify itself with the key named "roadwarrior":

<pre class="cmdbox">
ikev2 'roadwarrior' active esp \
        from 0.0.0.0/0 to 0.0.0.0/0 \
        peer 192.0.2.1 \
        srcid roadwarrior \
        dstid server1.domain
</pre>

One caveat with using an OpenBSD client is that it doesn't send configuration
requests to the responder to configure its IP, so the initiator needs to
manually NAT its outgoing packets on the <code>enc0</code> interface so that
packets appear on the responder with an IP on the VPN subnet
This can be achieved with the following rule:

<pre class="cmdbox">
match out log on enc0 inet all nat-to 10.0.5.2
</pre>

With that configuration, the flows look like this:

<!-- XXX this is only going to work if there's a single client -->
<pre class="cmdbox">
server1$ <b>ipsecctl -sf</b>
flow esp in from 10.0.5.0/24 to 0.0.0.0/0 peer 203.0.113.2 type use
flow esp out from 0.0.0.0/0 to 10.0.5.0/24 peer 203.0.113.2 type require

roadwarrior$ <b>ipsecctl -sf</b>
flow esp in from 0.0.0.0/0 to 0.0.0.0/0 peer 192.0.2.1 type use
flow esp out from 0.0.0.0/0 to 0.0.0.0/0 peer 192.0.2.1 type require
</pre>

The responder should have a proper NAT configuration for the road warrior
client.

<p>
Since all traffic goes through the VPN, including traffic targeted at
localhost, it might be necessary to exclude this traffic from the flows to
ensure connections to services running locally (such as a local resolver) reach
the right target.
This can be achieved by adding a single line to <code>/etc/ipsec.conf</code> on
the initiator:

<pre class="cmdbox">
flow from 127.0.0.1/32 to 127.0.0.1/32 type bypass
</pre>

After starting the initiator, this additional rule must be loaded using
<code>ipsecctl</code>:

<pre class="cmdbox">
roadwarrior# <b>ipsecctl -f /etc/ipsec.conf</b>
</pre>

This will happen at boot if IPsec has been enabled with
<code>rcctl enable ipsec</code>.

<p>
The flows on the initiator should now look like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
flow esp in from 0.0.0.0/0 to 0.0.0.0/0 peer 192.0.2.1 type use
flow esp in from 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.1 type bypass
flow esp out from 0.0.0.0/0 to 0.0.0.0/0 peer 192.0.2.1 type require
flow esp out from 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.1 type bypass
</pre>

Gracefully stopping the VPN on the initiator can be achieved using
<code>ikectl decouple</code> (<code>iked</code> is still running, pending
<code>ikectl couple</code> so that it reconnects to the responder) or with
<code>ikectl reset sa &amp;&amp; rcctl stop iked</code> to permanently
stop <code>iked</code> and ensure no flows are left behind.

<h3 id="clientandroid">With an Android Client</h3>

The default Android VPN client only supports IKEv1.
To use IKEv2, <a href="https://www.strongswan.org/">strongSwan</a> is
an option.

<p>
It is also required to set up a PKI and X.509 certificates so that
the initiator can validate the certificate advertised by the responder:

<pre class="cmdbox">
server1# <b>ikectl ca vpn create</b>
server1# <b>ikectl ca vpn install</b>
certificate for CA 'vpn' installed into /etc/iked/ca/ca.crt
CRL for CA 'vpn' installed to /etc/iked/crls/ca.crl
server1# <b>ikectl ca vpn certificate server1.domain create</b>
server1# <b>ikectl ca vpn certificate server1.domain install</b>
writing RSA key
server1# <b>cp /etc/iked/ca/ca.crt /var/www/htdocs/</b>
</pre>

On the android device, browse to <code>http://192.0.2.1/ca.crt</code> and
import the CA certificate in the strongSwan client.

From that point, there are several choices to authenticate the initiator to the
responder:

<ul>
  <li>EAP with username/password
  <li>X.509 certificate
</ul>

The responder needs to provide an IP address to the initiator, and eventually
also a nameserver.
This is achieved with the <code>config</code> directives.

<h4 id="autheap">Using MSCHAP-V2 for EAP Authentication</h4>

A responder config needs to specify a list of username/password, and that it
will use <code>eap "mschap-v2"</code> (which is the only EAP method supported
for now) as such:

<pre class="cmdbox">
user 'android' 'password'
ikev2 'responder_eap' passive esp \
        from 0.0.0.0/0 to 10.0.5.0/24 \
        local 192.0.2.1 peer any \
        srcid server1.domain \
        eap "mschap-v2" \
        config address 10.0.5.0/24 \
        config name-server 192.0.2.1 \
        tag "ROADW"
</pre>

In the strongSwan client, a new profile is configured using:

<ul>
  <li><i>IKEv2 EAP</i> for the VPN type
  <li><code>192.0.2.1</code> for the <i>server</i> field
  <li>the login/password values set in the responder config
  <li>the newly imported <code>CN=VPN CA</code> certificate for the
      <i>CA certificate</i> field
  <li><code>client1.domain</code> for the <i>User identity</i> field
  <li><code>server1.domain</code> in the <i>Server identity</i> field
      (under 'advanced settings')
</ul>

With that, the Android device can connect to the responder, authenticate the
responder certificate with the CA cert, authenticate itself to the responder
with the EAP login/password, get an address in the <code>10.0.5.0/24</code>
network, and all its traffic goes through the VPN, using
<code>192.0.2.1</code> as its DNS server.

<h4 id="authx509">Using X.509 Certificate Authentication</h4>

For this method, a certificate is generated for the client, installed in
<code>iked ca</code>, exported as an archive, and the .pfx file should be
made available online so that the client can install it.

The .pfx file bundles:

<ul>
  <li>the X.509 certificate
  <li>the X.509 private key, encrypted with RSA
  <li>the private RSA key used to encrypt the X.509 private key
  <li>the public RSA key
</ul>

<pre class="cmdbox">
server1# <b>ikectl ca vpn certificate client1.domain create</b>
server1# <b>cp /etc/ssl/vpn/client1.domain.crt /etc/iked/certs/</b>
server1# <b>ikectl ca vpn certificate client1.domain export</b>
server1# <b>tar -C /tmp -xzf client1.domain.tgz *pfx</b>
server1# <b>cp /tmp/export/client1.domain.pfx /var/www/htdocs/client1.domain.pfx</b>
</pre>

The CA public certificate and client certificate bundle have to be imported in
the strongSwan client when configuring the new profile.

<p>
The responder config is slightly simpler since there's no need to specify
<code>eap</code> nor set a username/password:

<pre class="cmdbox">
ikev2 'responder_x509' passive esp \
        from 0.0.0.0/0 to 10.0.5.0/24 \
        local 192.0.2.1 peer any \
        srcid server1.domain \
        config address 10.0.5.0/24 \
        config name-server 192.0.2.1 \
        tag "ROADW"
</pre>

In the strongSwan client, a new profile is configured, using:

<ul>
  <li><i>IKEv2 certificate</i> for the VPN type
  <li><code>192.0.2.1</code> for the <i>server</i> field
  <li>the newly imported <code>CN=client1.domain</code> certificate for the
      <i>User certificate</i> field
  <li><code>client1.domain</code> for the <i>User identity</i> field
  <li><code>server1.domain</code> in the <i>Server identity</i> field (under
      'advanced settings')
</ul>

Like in the EAP case, the Android device can now connect to the responder and
use the VPN.

<h3 id="clientwindows">With a Windows Client</h3>

Windows 7 and later provide an IKEv2 initiator that also requires the use of
X.509 certificates, which need to be exported as .pfx/.p12 bundles and imported
into the local machine (not the user account) certificate store, both for the
CA and the client, either using the graphical Microsoft Management Console
(type mmc in a command line and add the Certificates snap-in as a computer
account) or the certutil command with Windows 10.
Import <code>ca.crt</code> in the <i>certificate authority</i> store, and
<code>ClientIP.p12</code> in the <i>personal</i> store.

The <a href="https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Win7Certs">StrongSwan</a>
project has a good documentation on this topic, with screenshots.

<p>
Windows doesn't easily allow setting the <code>srcid</code> parameter for the
client, so the CN field of the client certificate has to match the client FQDN
sent to the responder, or its IP by default.
It is also required that <code>srcid</code> on the responder matches the
responder FQDN (or its IP, if not using FQDN) - otherwise one might experience
a dreaded <code>error 3801</code>.
The Libreswan project has
<a href="https://libreswan.org/wiki/VPN_server_for_remote_clients_using_IKEv2#Common_Windows_7_client_errors">valuable details</a>
on those <a href="https://libreswan.org/wiki/Interoperability#Windows_Certificate_requirements">requirements</a>.

<p>
Once the certificates are imported, configure a new VPN connection with:

<ul>
  <li>the responder FQDN for the target hostname in the <i>general</i> tab
  <li><i>IKEv2</i> for the type in the <i>security</i> tab
  <li>either 'machine certificate' or 'EAP authentication' for the
      authentication
  <li>if using EAP, the login/password will be prompted upon connection
</ul>

The responder configuration file will be similar to the Android case.

<pre class='cmdbox'>
user 'windows' 'password'
ikev2 'responder_eap' passive esp \
        from 0.0.0.0/0 to 10.0.5.0/24 \
        local 192.0.2.1 peer any \
        srcid server1.domain.fqdn \
        eap "mschap-v2" \
        config address 10.0.5.0/24 \
        config name-server 192.0.2.1 \
        tag "ROADW"
</pre>

By default, all the windows traffic will now go through the IKEv2 VPN.

<p>
At the time of writing, current versions of Windows use weak encryption
by default (3DES/SHA1).
This can be corrected with the PowerShell command
<tt>Set-VpnConnectionIPsecConfiguration</tt>.

<h2 id="clientikev1">Connecting to an IKEv1/L2TP VPN</h2>

Sometimes, one doesn't control the VPN server, and is only given the choice to
connect to an IKEv1 server.
In that case, the <code>xl2tpd</code> third-party package is needed to act
as an L2TP client.

<p>
It is first required to enable
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd">isakmpd(8)</a> and <code>ipsec</code>
services so that the daemon is started and the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.conf">ipsec.conf(5)</a>
configuration file loaded at boot:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl enable ipsec</b>
# <b>rcctl enable isakmpd</b>
# <b>rcctl set isakmpd flags -K</b>
</pre>

The following
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.conf">ipsec.conf(5)</a>
configuration should allow to connect to an IKEv1 server at
<code>A.B.C.D</code> with a provided PSK, only allowing the UDP port 1701
for L2TP:

<pre class="cmdbox">
ike dynamic esp transport proto udp from egress to A.B.C.D port l2tp \
        psk mekmitasdigoat
</pre>

Starting <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd">isakmpd(8)</a> and loading
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.conf">ipsec.conf(5)</a> using
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsecctl">ipsecctl(8)</a> should allow you
to visualize configured Security Associations (SAs) and flows:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl start isakmpd</b>
# <b>ipsecctl -f /etc/ipsec.conf</b>
# <b>ipsecctl -sa</b>
FLOWS:
flow esp in proto udp from A.B.C.D port l2tp to W.X.Y.Z peer A.B.C.D srcid my.client.fqdn dstid A.B.C.D/32 type use
flow esp out proto udp from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D port l2tp peer A.B.C.D srcid my.client.fqdn dstid A.B.C.D/32 type require

SAD:
esp transport from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z spi 0x0d16ad1c auth hmac-sha1 enc aes
esp transport from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D spi 0xcd0549ba auth hmac-sha1 enc aes
</pre>

If this is not the case, it might be required to tweak the phase 1 (Main) and
phase 2 (Quick) parameters, when both parties exchange crypto parameters to
agree on the best combination available.
Ideally, those parameters should be provided by the remote server admin, and
should be used in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.conf">ipsec.conf(5)</a>:

<pre class="cmdbox">
ike dynamic esp transport proto udp from egress to A.B.C.D port l2tp \
        main auth "hmac-sha1" enc "3des" group modp1024 \
        quick auth "hmac-sha1" enc "aes" \
        psk mekmitasdigoat
</pre>

Once the IKEv1 tunnel is up and running, the L2TP tunnel needs to be configured.
OpenBSD doesn't provide an L2TP client by default, so installing
<code>xl2tpd</code> is required.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>pkg_add xl2tpd</b>
</pre>

Refer to <code>/usr/local/share/doc/pkg-readmes/xl2tpd</code> for instructions
on how to properly setup the L2TP client.
