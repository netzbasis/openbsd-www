<h2 id="Intro">Introduction to X</h2>

The X Window System (sometimes just called "X") is the environment which
provides graphics services to OpenBSD and other Unix-based systems.
By itself, X provides very little, since one also must have a window manager
to present a user interface.
OpenBSD ships with the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cwm">cwm(1)</a>,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fvwm">fvwm(1)</a> and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/twm">twm(1)</a> window managers, although
many others are available via <a href="faq15.html">ports and packages</a>.

<p>
It is possible to run X clients on a system without any graphical support.
For example, one could have an application (the X client) running on an
ARM system, displaying its output on an amd64's graphical display (the X
server).
Since X is a well-defined, cross-platform protocol, it is even possible
to have an X application running on (for example) a Linux machine use an
OpenBSD machine for its display.
The client and server can also be running on the same machine, and for
most of this section, that will be the assumption.

<h2 id="ConfigX">Configuring X</h2>

For the majority of hardware on the most common platforms, X requires no
configuration at all.

<p>
The details of manual X configuration vary considerably from platform
to platform.
In all cases, there will be instructions and other platform-specific
information in <tt>/usr/X11R6/README</tt> on the installed system.

<h2 id="StartingX">Starting X</h2>

There are two common ways to run X: by manually invoking the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/startx">startx(1)</a> command at
a console, or via <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/xdm">xdm(1)</a>.

<p>
If you didn't enable xdm at install time, you can do so like any other
system daemon:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl enable xdm</b>
</pre></blockquote>

On some platforms, you will need to disable the console
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/getty">getty(8)</a> to use xdm.
This is not needed on amd64, i386 or macppc.

<h2 id="CustomizingX">Customizing X</h2>

OpenBSD's default X environment is fully functional, but you may wish to
customize it.

<p>
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/startx">startx(1)</a> command looks for
a <tt>.xinitrc</tt> file in the user's home directory.
This is usually a shell script, which can start as many programs as desired.
Generally, most of the programs run by this script should run in the
background, though the last one (typically the window manager) should run in
the foreground.
When it exits, the script will exit, and X will be shut down.

<p>
In the simplest case, this can be as little as just the name of the
window manager you wish to invoke:

<blockquote><pre>
cwm
</pre></blockquote>

Or you can get a little more fancy:

<blockquote><pre>
xconsole -geometry -0+0 -fn 5x7 &
oclock -geometry 75x75-0-0 &
xsetroot -solid grey &
cwm
</pre></blockquote>

Note that only the window manager is not being run in the background. 
This means that X will stay running until it exits.

<p>
If a user's home directory does not have a <tt>.xinitrc</tt> file, the
system's <tt>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc</tt> file is used.

When <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/xdm">xdm(1)</a> starts, it runs
<tt>/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession</tt>, which will check to see if the user has
a <tt>.xsession</tt> configuration file in their home directory.
If you wish to change your default window manager, simply invoke it in
<tt>.xsession</tt>.
Any programs you want started with X can be placed here, but all should
be backgrounded except for your window manager again.
