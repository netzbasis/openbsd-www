<h2 id="wheel">10.1 - Why does it say that I'm in the wrong group when I try to su root?</h2>

<p>
On OpenBSD, users who are in the <kbd>wheel</kbd>
group are allowed to use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=su&amp;sektion=1">su(1)</a>
to become root.
Otherwise, the user will receive an error.

<p>
If you are creating new users with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&amp;sektion=8">adduser(8)</a>,
you can add them to the <kbd>wheel</kbd> group by answering "wheel" at the
"<tt>Invite <i>user</i> into other groups:</tt>" prompt.
Existing users must be added to the <kbd>wheel</kbd> group by hand.
Here is an example of a <kbd>/etc/group</kbd> entry which has had the user
<b>ericj</b> added to the <kbd>wheel</kbd> group:

<blockquote><pre>
wheel:*:0:root,ericj
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you want to give access to superuser
privileges without adding users to the <kbd>wheel</kbd> group, you can use
<a href="#doas">doas(1)</a>.

<h2 id="DupFS">10.2 - How do I duplicate a filesystem?</h2>

<p>
To duplicate your filesystem use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dump&amp;sektion=8">dump(8)</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=restore&amp;sektion=8">restore(8)</a>.
For example, to duplicate everything under directory <kbd>SRC</kbd> to
directory <kbd>DST</kbd>, do a:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /SRC; dump 0f - . | (cd /DST; restore -rf - )</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
dump is designed to give you plenty of backup capabilities, and it may
be an overkill if you just want to duplicate a part of a (or an entire)
filesystem. The command
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tar&amp;sektion=1">tar(1)</a>
may be faster for this operation.  The format looks very similar:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /SRC; tar cf -  . | (cd /DST; tar xpf - )</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="rc">10.3 - How do I start daemons with the system? (Overview of
rc(8))</h2>

OpenBSD itself uses an
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc&amp;sektion=8">rc(8)</a>
style startup. This uses a few key files for startup.

<ul>
  <li>/etc/rc - Main script. Should not be edited.
  <li>/etc/rc.conf - Configuration file used by <i>/etc/rc</i> to set
  startup parameters for the system.
  Should not be edited.
  <li>/etc/rc.conf.local - Configuration file that overrides
  settings in /etc/rc.conf so you don't have to touch /etc/rc.conf
  itself, which is important when upgrading your system.
  <li>/etc/netstart - Script used to initialize the network. Shouldn't
  be edited.
  <li>/etc/rc.local - Script used for local administration. This is
  where new daemons or host specific information can be set.
  <li>/etc/rc.securelevel - Script which runs commands that must be run
  before the security level changes. See
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=init&amp;sektion=8">init(8)</a>
  <li>/etc/rc.shutdown - Script run on shutdown. Put anything you want
  done before shutdown in this file. See
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc.shutdown&amp;sektion=8">rc.shutdown(8)</a>
</ul>

<h3>How does rc(8) work?</h3>

<p>
The main files a system administrator should concentrate on are
<i>/etc/rc.conf</i> (for guidance), <i>/etc/rc.conf.local</i> (for
changes), <i>/etc/rc.local</i> and <i>/etc/rc.shutdown</i>.
To get a look of how the rc(8) procedure works, here is the flow:

<p>
After the kernel is booted, <i>/etc/rc</i> is started:
<ul>
  <li>Filesystems are checked.
  <li>Default configuration variables are read in from
      <i>/etc/rc.conf</i>, then local changes to those variables are
      read from <i>/etc/rc.conf.local</i>.
      Settings in rc.conf.local will override those in rc.conf.
  <li>Filesystems are mounted
  <li>Clears out <i>/tmp</i> and preserves any editor files
  <li>Configures the network via <i>/etc/netstart</i>
  <ul>
    <li>Configures your interfaces up.
    <li>Sets your hostname, domainname, etc.
  </ul>
  <li>Starts system daemons
  <li>Performs various other checks (quotas, savecore, etc)
  <li>Runs <i>/etc/rc.firsttime</i>
  <li>Runs <i>/etc/rc.local</i>
  <li>Processes local and package scripts in <i>/etc/rc.d</i>
</ul>

<h3>Starting Daemons and Services that come with OpenBSD</h3>

<p>
Most daemons and services that come with OpenBSD are controlled on boot
by variables defined in the <i>/etc/rc.conf</i> configuration file.
Take a look at the
<a href="http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/etc/rc.conf?content-type=text/plain">/etc/rc.conf</a>
file. You'll see lines similar to this:

<blockquote><pre>
ftpd_flags=NO           # for non-inetd use: ftpd_flags=""
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
A line like this shows that
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftpd&amp;sektion=8">ftpd(8)</a>
is not to start up with the system (at least not as a daemon via rc(8);
ftpd is often run out of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;sektion=8">inetd(8)</a>,
see <a href="faq10.html#AnonFTP">Anonymous FTP FAQ</a> to read more
about this).
Each line has a comment showing you the flags for common usage of that
daemon or service.
This doesn't mean that you must run that daemon or service with those
flags.
Read the relevant manual page to see how you can have that daemon or
service start up in any way you like.

<p>
We strongly suggest you do not alter <i>/etc/rc.conf</i> itself.
Instead, create or edit the file <i>/etc/rc.conf.local</i>, copy just the lines
you need to change from <i>/etc/rc.conf</i> and adjust them as you like.
This makes future upgrades easier -- all the changes are in the one
file that isn't touched during upgrade.

<p>
For example, here is the default line pertaining to <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ntpd&amp;sektion=8">ntpd(8)</a>.

<blockquote><pre>
ntpd_flags=NO          # for normal use: ""
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Here you can see that starting up ntpd normally requires no flags, so a
line like <tt>ntpd_flags=""</tt> added to <i>/etc/rc.conf.local</i>
will do the job.
But to start ntpd with options, such as <tt>-s</tt> to immediately
update the system clock at boot you would need a line like
<tt>ntpd_flags="-s"</tt> instead.

<h3>Starting up local daemons and configuration</h3>

<p>
For other daemons which you might install on the system via packages or
other ways, you could use the <i>/etc/rc.local</i> file.
For example, I've installed a daemon which lies at
/usr/local/sbin/daemonx. I want it to start at boot time.
I could put an entry into <i>/etc/rc.local</i> like this:

<blockquote><pre>
if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/daemonx ]; then
	echo 'Starting daemonx'; /usr/local/sbin/daemonx
fi
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
(If the daemon does not automatically detach on startup, remember to add
a "&amp;" at the end of the command line.)

<p>
From now on, this daemon will be started at boot. You will be able to see
any errors on boot, a normal boot with no errors would show a line like
this:

<blockquote><pre>
Starting daemonx
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>The <i>/etc/rc.d/</i> directory</h3>
OpenBSD's system daemons ("services") are started, stopped and
controlled by
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc.d&amp;sektion=8"
><i>/etc/rc.d</i></a>.
All system daemons are handled by these scripts, and most add-in
<a href="faq15.html">packages</a> are as well.

<p>
These scripts, one per daemon, are invoked by <tt>rc</tt>.
The order for system daemons is coded into <tt>rc</tt>, and the order
for add-in packages is managed by the <tt>pkg_scripts</tt> environment
variable, which would be set in <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt>.
Note that simply placing a script in this directory does not cause it to
be run on boot; the name of the script must be specified in the
<tt>pkg_scripts</tt> variable to start on boot.

<p>
The starting of system scripts is determined by entries in the
<tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> file.
For example, <tt>/etc/rc.d/ntpd</tt> does not start
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ntpd&amp;sektion=8">ntpd(8)</a>
unless <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt> or <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> contains a
line defining the "<tt>ntpd_flags</tt>" variable.
To help make sure your system will come up as expected on the next boot,
the <tt>rc.d</tt> scripts will not run their daemon if the appropriate
variable is not defined.
You can, of course, manually invoke <tt>/usr/sbin/ntpd</tt> directly
with whatever options you wish, if you wish to run the program manually.

<p>
Note that rather than having each script in rc.d managing the entire
startup, shutdown, reload, restart, and check operations, 
most rc.d scripts can be reduced to specifying a very few variables,
and invoking the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc.subr&amp;sektion=8">rc.subr</a>
script, which manages most of the standard way of doing these tasks.

<p>
For example, our above <tt>daemonx</tt> application could be started
with a <tt>/etc/rc.d/daemonx</tt> file consisting of:

<blockquote><pre>
#!/bin/sh

daemon="/usr/local/sbin/daemonx"

. /etc/rc.d/rc.subr

rc_cmd $1
</pre></blockquote>

and adding the daemon name to the <tt>pkg_scripts</tt> variable in
<tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt>.

<h3>rc.shutdown</h3>

<p>
<i>/etc/rc.shutdown</i> is a script that is run at shutdown. Anything
you want done before the system shuts down should be added to this file.

<h2 id="doas">10.4 - Introducing doas(1) -- or -- What happened to sudo?</h2>
<h3>10.4.1 - What is doas(1)?</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=doas&amp;sektion=1">doas(1)</a>
allows a user to temporarily run commands as the root (or other) user.
For example, if appropriately configured,
<blockquote><pre>
$ doas fdisk sd1
</pre></blockquote>
allows you to run the command
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8">fdisk(8)</a>
as if you were root.
Key words there are "appropriately configured", of course.
You don't want average users to be able to get root privileges for any
command they wish to run!
Typically, though certainly not required, users in the "wheel" group
are given permission to run commands with doas.

<h3>10.4.2 - Why doas(1)?</h3>
One common challenge when professionally administering computers is
the contradictory requirements of multiple people being able to manage
every machine and that account passwords should not shared.
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=doas&amp;sektion=1">doas(1)</a>
solves this problem by permitting a certain subset of your users (for
example, members of the "wheel" group) to run predetermined commands
(often, all commands) as another user (often root).
Now, anyone can run administrative commands, only needing to authenticate
as themselves, they do not need to use the root account or know the
root password.

<p>
An added advantage of "doas" is all activity is logged.
It is possible to find out who ran an application.

<p>
Using a properly configured doas(1) on OpenBSD, one can completely
disable the root account, eliminating all root password management
issues.

<p>
It is also considered good practice by many to use doas when absolutely
necessary to run a command as root, rather than sitting at a root
console prompt.  This way, an erroneously typed command is less likely
to have catastrophic results.
However, this is subject to some debate.
It is possible to cause as much chaos and havoc with a "finger-memory"
(or just incorrect command) invocation of doas as it is when logged in as
root.
For this reason, we do not blindly side with those that chant "always
use 'doas', never use 'root'!" or spend hours making things happen
without root.
Notably, if you set doas to not require a the confirmation of your
password, any script or application running as you can invoke doas(1)
to make any changes to your system as root.
For this reason, for personal systems, it is probably better to either
just use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=su&amp;sektion=1">su(1)</a>
to elevate one's self to root status, or use doas(1) with the password
option.

<h3>10.4.3 - "Sounds like sudo!"</h3>
Yes, doas(1) was inspired by <a href="http://www.sudo.ws/">sudo</a>.
doas(1) is OpenBSD's replacement for the sudo command.

<p>
The complexity of sudo has prevented the importing of the most
current versions, and the complexity of the sudoers config file
has discouraged many users from doing anything other than uncomment one
line in the conf file.
In short, sudo's code is too complicated for the way most users use it,
and its configuration is too difficult for more advanced uses.

<p>
doas(1) is intended to have a simpler, and thus hopefully more secure
code base and a simpler configuration file.
From a user standpoint, the two are very similar.

<p>
For those needing the functionality of sudo, it's available as a
<a href="faq15.html">package</a>

<h3>10.4.4 - Using doas(1) -- basic doas.conf(5)</h3>
<p>
A very basic
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=doas.conf&amp;sektion=5">doas.conf</a>
might look like this:
<blockquote><pre>
permit keepenv { PKG_PATH ENV PS1 SSH_AUTH_SOCK } :wheel
</pre></blockquote>

This file gives users in the wheel group no password root-level access
to all commands, with the environment variables PKG_PATH, ENV, PS1, and
SSH_AUTH_SOCK passed through to the program you are invoking.
The user will be asked to verify their password before the command is
run.

<p>
A more sophisticated doas.conf(5) file which would permit you to build
OpenBSD from source using doas(1) without entering your password every
time might be:

<blockquote><pre>
permit nopass keepenv { PKG_PATH ENV PS1 SSH_AUTH_SOCK } :wheel
permit nopass keepenv { \
    FTPMODE PKG_CACHE PKG_PATH SM_PATH SSH_AUTH_SOCK \
    DESTDIR DISTDIR FETCH_CMD FLAVOR GROUP MAKE MAKECONF \
    MULTI_PACKAGES NOMAN OKAY_FILES OWNER PKG_DBDIR \
    PKG_DESTDIR PKG_TMPDIR PORTSDIR RELEASEDIR SHARED_ONLY \
    SUBPACKAGE WRKOBJDIR SUDO_PORT_V1 } :wsrc
</pre></blockquote>

While the "nopass" option makes using "doas" very easy, it can also be
invoked by any script or program, without the user's knowledge or
permission.
For this reason, systems used as general purpose workstations should
probably not use the "nopass" option, if using doas(1) at all.
The alternative is using <a href="#wheel">su(1)</a> and the root
password to use the root account.

<p>
If you don't like the idea of any script or program you run being able
to silently invoke doas(1) to run something as root, but you find typing
your password over and over annoying, you may want to create a user
for administrative tasks, such as "admin", and have a <tt>doas.conf</tt>
file like this:
<blockquote><pre>
permit :wheel as admin
permit nopass admin
</pre></blockquote>

Now, anyone who is in the wheel group can become "admin" with just one
entry of their password, and then admin can run the commands they wish
without a password until they drop back to their normal user.


<h2 id="vipw">10.8 - I edited /etc/passwd, but the changes didn't seem to take
place. Why?</h2>

<p>
If you edit <i>/etc/passwd</i> directly, your changes will be lost.
OpenBSD generates <i>/etc/passwd</i> dynamically with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pwd_mkdb&amp;sektion=8">pwd_mkdb(8)</a>.
The main password file in OpenBSD is <i>/etc/master.passwd</i>.
According to pwd_mkdb(8),

<blockquote><pre>
FILES
     /etc/master.passwd  current password file
     /etc/passwd         a 6th Edition-style password file
     /etc/pwd.db         insecure password database file
     /etc/pwd.db.tmp     temporary file
     /etc/spwd.db        secure password database file
     /etc/spwd.db.tmp    temporary file
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In a traditional Unix password file, such as /etc/passwd, everything
including the user's encrypted password is available to anyone on the
system (and is a prime target for programs such as Crack).
4.4BSD introduced the master.passwd file, which has an extended format
(with additional options beyond those provided by /etc/passwd) and is
only readable by root. For faster access to data, the library calls
which access this data normally read /etc/pwd.db and /etc/spwd.db.

<p>
OpenBSD does come with a tool with which you should edit your password
file. It is called
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8">vipw(8)</a>.
Vipw will use vi (or your favourite editor defined per $EDITOR) to edit
/etc/master.passwd. After you are done editing, it will re-create
/etc/passwd, /etc/pwd.db, and /etc/spwd.db as per your changes.
Vipw also takes care of locking these files, so that if anyone else
attempts to change them at the same time, they will be denied access.

<h2 id="AddDelUser">10.9 - What is the best way to add and delete users?</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD provides two commands for easily adding users to the system: 

<ul>
<li><a href="#adduser">adduser(8)</a>
<li><a href="#user">user(8)</a>
</ul>

You can also add users by hand, using 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8">vipw(8)</a>,
but this is more difficult for most operations.

<p id="adduser">
The easiest way to add a user in OpenBSD is to use the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&amp;sektion=8">adduser(8)</a>
script. You can configure adduser(8) by editing
<i>/etc/adduser.conf</i>.
adduser(8) allows for consistency checks on <i>/etc/passwd</i>,
<i>/etc/group</i>, and shell databases. It will create the entries and
$HOME directories for you. It can even send a message to the user
welcoming them. Here is an example user, <b>testuser</b>, being added to
a system.
He/she will be given the $HOME directory <i>/home/testuser</i>, made a
member of the group <b>guest</b>, and given the shell <i>/bin/ksh</i>.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>adduser</b>
Use option ``-silent'' if you don't want to see all warnings and questions.

Reading /etc/shells
Check /etc/master.passwd
Check /etc/group

Ok, let's go.
Don't worry about mistakes. There will be a chance later to correct any input.
Enter username []: <b>testuser</b>
Enter full name []: <b>Test FAQ User</b>
Enter shell csh ksh nologin sh [ksh]: <b>ksh</b>
Uid [1002]: <b><i>Enter</i></b>
Login group testuser [testuser]: <b>guest</b>
Login group is ``guest''. Invite testuser into other groups: guest no 
[no]: <b>no</b>
Login class authpf daemon default staff [default]: <b><i>Enter</i></b>
Enter password []: <b><i>Type password, then Enter</i></b>
Enter password again []: <b><i>Type password, then Enter</i></b>

Name:        testuser
Password:    ****
Fullname:    Test FAQ User
Uid:         1002
Gid:         31 (guest)
Groups:      guest
Login Class: default

Shell:       /bin/ksh
OK? (y/n) [y]: <b>y</b>
Added user ``testuser''
Copy files from /etc/skel to /home/testuser
Add another user? (y/n) [y]: <b>n</b>
Goodbye!
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To delete users you should use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rmuser&amp;sektion=8">rmuser(8)</a>
utility. This will remove all existence of a user. It will remove any
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=crontab&amp;sektion=1">crontab(1)</a>
entries, their $HOME dir (if it is owned by the user), and their mail.
Of course it will also remove their <i>/etc/passwd</i> and
<i>/etc/group</i> entries. Next is an example of removing the user that
was added above. Notice you are prompted for the name, and whether or
not to remove the user's home directory.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rmuser</b>
Enter login name for user to remove: <b>testuser</b>
Matching password entry:

testuser:$2a$07$ZWnBOsbqMJ.ducQBfsTKUe3PL97Ve1AHWJ0A4uLamniLNXLeYrEie:1002
:31::0:0:Test FAQ User:/home/testuser:/bin/ksh

Is this the entry you wish to remove? <b>y</b>
Remove user's home directory (/home/testuser)? <b>y</b>
Updating password file, updating databases, done.
Updating group file: done.
Removing user's home directory (/home/testuser): done.
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="user">Adding users via user(8)</h3>

<p>
These tools are less interactive than the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&amp;sektion=8">adduser(8)</a> 
command, which makes them easier to use in scripts.

<p>
The full set of tools is:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=group&amp;sektion=8">group(8)</a>

</ul>

<h4>Actually adding users</h4>

<p>
The command <i>/usr/sbin/user</i> is just a frontend to the rest of the
<i>/usr/sbin/user*</i> commands.
Therefore, the following commands can be added by using <b>user add</b>
or <b>useradd</b>,
which form you chose doesn't change the results at all.
Remember, since user(8) is not interactive, the easiest way to add users
is with adduser(8).

<p>
useradd(8) is less daunting to use if you know the default settings
beforehand.
These settings are located in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=usermgmt.conf&amp;sektion=5">usermgmt.conf(5)</a>
and can be viewed by doing:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>user add -D</b>
group           users
base_dir        /home
skel_dir        /etc/skel
shell           /bin/csh
inactive        0
expire          Null (unset)
range           1000..60000
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
These defaults will be used unless you specify alternatives
with the command line options. For example, we want the user to
be added to the group <b>guest</b>, not <b>users</b>.
One more little hurdle with adding users, is that passwords must be
specified on the command line.
Importantly, the passwords must be encrypted, so you need to use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=encrypt&amp;sektion=1">encrypt(1)</a>
utility.
For example: OpenBSD's passwords by default use the Blowfish
algorithm for 6 rounds.
Here is an example to create an encrypted password to give to
useradd(8).

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>encrypt -p -b 6</b>
Enter string:
$2a$06$YOdOZM3.4m6MObBXjeZtBOWArqC2.uRJZXUkOghbieIvSWXVJRzlq
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now that we have an encrypted password, we are ready to add the user.
We will add the same user with the same specifications as the user
we added <a href="#adduser">above</a>, via adduser(8).

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>user add -p '$2a$06$YOdOZM3.4m6MObBXjeZtBOWArqC2.uRJZXUkOghbieIvSWXVJRzlq' -u 1002 \
-s /bin/ksh -c "Test FAQ User" -m -g guest testuser</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Make sure to use '&nbsp;' (single quotes)
around the password string, not
&quot;&nbsp;&quot; (double quotes)
as the shell will interpret these before sending it to user(8). In
addition to that, make sure you specify the <b>-m</b> option if you want
the user's home directory created and the files from
<i>/etc/skel</i> copied over.

<p>
To see that the user was created correctly, we can use many different
utilities. Below are a few commands you can use to quickly check that
everything was created correctly.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>ls -la /home</b>
total 14
drwxr-xr-x   5 root      wheel   512 May 12 14:29 .
drwxr-xr-x  15 root      wheel   512 Apr 25 20:52 ..
drwxr-xr-x  24 ericj     wheel  2560 May 12 13:38 ericj
drwxr-xr-x   2 testuser  guest   512 May 12 14:28 testuser
$ <b>id testuser</b>
uid=1002(testuser) gid=31(guest) groups=31(guest)
$ <b>finger testuser</b>
Login: testuser                         Name: Test FAQ User
Directory: /home/testuser               Shell: /bin/ksh
Last login Sat Apr 22 16:05 (EDT) on ttyC2
No Mail.
No Plan.
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In addition to these commands, user(8) provides its own utility to show
user characteristics, called userinfo(8).

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>userinfo testuser</b>
login   testuser
passwd  *
uid     1002
groups  guest
change  Wed Dec 31 19:00:00 1969
class
gecos   Test FAQ User
dir     /home/testuser
shell   /bin/ksh
expire  Wed Dec 31 19:00:00 1969
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Removing users</h4>

<p>
To remove users with the user(8) hierarchy of commands, you will use
userdel(8). This is a very simple, yet usable command. To remove the
user created in the last example, simply:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>userdel -r testuser</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Notice the <b>-r</b> option, which must be specified if you want the
users home directory to be deleted as well. Alternatively, you can
specify <b>-p</b> and not <b>-r</b> and this will lock the user's
account, but not remove any information.

<h2 id="FTPOnly">10.10 - How do I create an ftp-only account (not anonymous FTP!)?</h2>

<p>
There are a few ways to do this, but a very common way to do such is to
add "<tt>/usr/bin/false</tt>" into "<tt>/etc/shells</tt>".
Then when you set a users shell to "<tt>/usr/bin/false</tt>", they will
not be able log in interactively, but will be able to use ftp
capabilities.  You may also want to restrict access by
<a href="#ftpchroot">Confining users to their home directory in
ftpd</a>.


<h2 id="Quotas">10.11 - Setting up Quotas</h2>

<p>
Quotas are used to limit user's space that they have available to them
on your disk drives. It can be very helpful in situations where you have
limited resources. Quotas can be set by user and/or by group.

<p>
The first step to setting up quotas is to make sure that "<tt>option
QUOTA</tt>" is in your <a href="faq5.html#Options">Kernel
Configuration</a>. This option is in the GENERIC kernel. After this, you
need to mark in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fstab&amp;sektion=5"><tt>/etc/fstab</tt></a>
the filesystems which will have quotas enabled.
The keywords <tt>userquota</tt> and <tt>groupquota</tt> should be used
to mark each filesystem that you will be using quotas on. By default,
the files <tt>quota.user</tt> and <tt>quota.group</tt> will be created
at the root of that filesystem to hold the quota information. This
default can be overridden by specifying the file name with the quota
option in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, such as
"<tt>userquota=/var/quotas/quota.user</tt>".
Here is an example <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> that has one filesystem with
userquotas enabled, and the quota file in a non-standard location:

<blockquote><pre>
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw,userquota=/var/quotas/quota.user 1 1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now it's time to set the user's quotas. To do so you use the utility
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=edquota&amp;sektion=8">edquota(8)</a>.
A simple use is just "<tt>edquota&nbsp;&lt;user&gt;</tt>". edquota(8)
will use vi(1) to edit the quotas unless the environmental variable
EDITOR is set to a different editor. For example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>edquota ericj</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This will give you output similar to this:

<blockquote><pre>
Quotas for user ericj:
/: KBytes in use: 62, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
        inodes in use: 25, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To add limits, edit it to give results like this:

<blockquote><pre>
Quotas for user ericj:
/: KBytes in use: 62, limits (soft = 1000, hard = 1050)
        inodes in use: 25, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that the quota allocation is in 1k blocks.
In this case, the softlimit is set to 1000k, and the hardlimit is set to
1050k. A softlimit is a limit where the user is just warned when
they cross it and have until their grace period is up to get their disk
usage below their limit. Grace periods can be set by using the
<b>-t</b> option on edquota(8). After the grace period is over
the softlimit is handled as a hardlimit. This usually results in an
allocation failure.

<p>
Now that the quotas are set, you need to turn the quotas on. To do this
use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=quotaon&amp;sektion=8">quotaon(8)</a>.
For example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>quotaon -a</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This will go through <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> to turn on the filesystems with
quota options. Now that quotas are up and running, you can view them
using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=quota&amp;sektion=1">quota(1)</a>.
Using a command of "<tt>quota &lt;user&gt;</tt>" will give that user's
information. When called with no arguments, the quota(1) command will
give your quota statistics. For example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>quota ericj</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Will result in output similar to this:

<blockquote><pre>
Disk quotas for user ericj (uid 1001): 
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
              /      62    1000    1050              27       0       0        
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
By default quotas set in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> will be started on boot. To
turn them off use

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>quotaoff -a</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="AnonFTP">10.13 - Setting up Anonymous FTP Services</h2>

<p>
Anonymous FTP allows users without accounts to access files on your
computer via the File Transfer Protocol. This will give an overview of
setting up the anonymous FTP server, and its logging, etc.

<h3>Adding the FTP account</h3>

<p>
To start off, you need to have an <i>ftp</i> account on your system.
This account should not have a usable password. Here we will set the login
directory to /home/ftp, but you can put it wherever you want.
When using anonymous ftp, the ftp daemon will chroot itself to the home
directory of the <i>ftp</i> user. To read up more on that, read the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftpd&amp;sektion=8">ftpd(8)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chroot&amp;sektion=2">chroot(2)</a>
man pages. Here is an example of adding the <i>ftp</i> user. I will do
this using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&amp;sektion=8">adduser(8)</a>.
We also need to add /usr/bin/false to our <i>/etc/shells</i>, this is
the &quot;shell&quot; that we will be giving to the <i>ftp</i> user.
This won't allow them to login, even though we will give them an empty
password. To do this you can simply do

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo /usr/bin/false &gt;&gt; /etc/shells</b>
</pre></blockquote>

After this, you are ready to add the <i>ftp</i> user:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>adduser</b>
Use option ``-silent'' if you don't want to see all warnings and questions.

Reading /etc/shells
Check /etc/master.passwd
Check /etc/group

Ok, let's go.
Don't worry about mistakes. There will be a chance later to correct any input.
Enter username []: <b>ftp</b>
Enter full name []: <b>anonymous ftp</b>
Enter shell csh false ksh nologin sh [ksh]: <b>false</b>
Uid [1002]: <b><i>Enter</i></b>
Login group ftp [ftp]: <b><i>Enter</i></b>
Login group is ``ftp''. Invite ftp into other groups: guest no 
[no]: <b><i>Enter</i></b>
Login class authpf daemon default staff [default]: <b><i>Enter</i></b>
Enter password []: <b><i>Enter</i></b>
Disable password logins for the user? (y/n) [n]: <b>y</b>

Name:        ftp
Password:    ****
Fullname:    anonymous ftp
Uid:         1002
Gid:         1002 (ftp)
Groups:      ftp
Login Class: default
HOME:        /home/ftp
Shell:       /usr/bin/false
OK? (y/n) [y]: <b><i>Enter</i></b>
Added user ``ftp''
Copy files from /etc/skel to /home/ftp
Add another user? (y/n) [y]: <b>n</b>
Goodbye!
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Directory Setup</h3>

<p>
Along with the user, this created the directory <tt>/home/ftp</tt>
(though you can use other locations as well, of course).
There are some changes that we will have to make to
get it ready for anonymous ftp. Again these changes are explained in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftpd&amp;sektion=8">ftpd(8)</a> man page.

<p>
You <b>do not</b> need to make a /home/ftp/usr or /home/ftp/bin
directory.
<ul>
<li><i>/home/ftp</i> - This is the main directory. It should be changed
to be owned by root and to have permissions of 555.
It should not be writable by the "<tt>ftp</tt>" user!
<li><i>/home/ftp/etc</i> - This is entirely optional and not
recommended, as it only serves to give out information on users which
exist on your box. If you want your anonymous ftp directory to appear to
have user and group names attached to your files, you should copy
<tt>/etc/pwd.db</tt> and <tt>/etc/group</tt> to this directory.
This directory should be mode 511, and the two files should be mode 444.
These are used to give owner names as opposed to numbers. There are no
passwords stored in <tt>pwd.db</tt>, they are all in <tt>spwd.db</tt>,
so don't copy that over.
Without the user files, the files will have their group and owners shown
as numbers, which is rarely a problem.
<li><i>/home/ftp/pub</i> - This is a standard directory to place files
in which you wish to share. This directory should also be mode 555.
</ul>

<p> 
Note that all these directories should be owned by ''root''. Here is a
listing of what the directories should look like after their creation.

<blockquote><pre>
# pwd
/home
# ls -laR ftp
total 5
dr-xr-xr-x  5 root  ftp    512 Jul  6 11:33 .
drwxr-xr-x  7 root  wheel  512 Jul  6 10:58 ..
dr-x--x--x  2 root  ftp    512 Jul  6 11:34 etc
dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  ftp    512 Jul  6 11:33 pub

ftp/etc:
total 43
dr-x--x--x  2 root  ftp    512 Jul  6 11:34 .
dr-xr-xr-x  5 root  ftp    512 Jul  6 11:33 ..
-r--r--r--  1 root  ftp    316 Jul  6 11:34 group
-r--r--r--  1 root  ftp  40960 Jul  6 11:34 pwd.db

ftp/pub:
total 2
dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  ftp  512 Jul  6 11:33 .
dr-xr-xr-x  5 root  ftp  512 Jul  6 11:33 ..
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Starting up the server and logging</h3>

<p>
You can choose to start ftpd either by
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;sektion=8">inetd(8)</a>
or from the
<a href="#rc">rc</a> scripts.
Generally, running ftpd as a daemon from the rc scripts is recommended
and is what we will show here; a sample line for running it from
inetd(8) is commented out in the default <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt>.

<p>
Here is an example line to add to <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> to start
ftpd(8) at boot.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>ftpd_flags="-llUSA"</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The options used here are:
<ul>
<li><tt><b>ll</b></tt> - detailed logging to syslog.
<li><tt><b>U </b></tt> - log users so 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=who&amp;sektion=1">who(1)</a>
and similar programs can see them.
<li><tt><b>S </b></tt> - log transfers to <tt>/var/log/ftpd</tt>.
<li><tt><b>A </b></tt> - permit only anonymous FTP transfers.
</ul>

<p>
It is not necessary to give startup options to ftpd to allow anonymous
connections; the preceding steps of creating the 'ftp' user is
sufficient.
However, to stop anonymous connections it isn't necessary to undo
everything, just restart ftpd with the <b>-n</b> option included.
Anonymous connections are then disabled.

<h3>Other relevant files</h3>

<ul>
<li><tt>/etc/ftpwelcome</tt> - This holds the Welcome message for people
once they have connected to your ftp server.
<li><tt>/etc/motd</tt> - This holds the message for people once they have
successfully logged into your ftp server.
<li><tt>.message</tt> - This file can be placed in any directory. It will
be shown once a user enters that directory.
</ul>

<h2 id="ftpchroot">10.14 - Confining users to their home directories in ftpd(8)</h2>

<p>
By default, when logging in by ftp, users can change to any directory on
the filesystem that they have access to.
This may not be desirable in some cases.
It is possible to restrict what users may see through ftp sessions by
chrooting them to their home directory.

<p>
If you only wish to allow chrooted ftp logins, use the <b>-A</b> option to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftpd&amp;sektion=8">ftpd(8)</a>.

<p>
If you wish to apply them more finely, OpenBSD's
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=login.conf&amp;sektion=5">login
capability infrastructure</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftpd&amp;sektion=8">ftpd(8)</a>
together make this easy.
<p>

Users in a login class with the <tt>ftp-chroot</tt> variable set are
automatically chrooted.
Additionally, you can add a username to the file <b>/etc/ftpchroot</b>
to chroot those usernames.
A user only needs to be listed in one of these locations.

<h2 id="Patches">10.15 - Applying patches in OpenBSD</h2>

<p>
Even with OpenBSD, bugs happen.
Some bugs may lead to reliability issues (i.e., something may cause
the system to stop functioning as desired). Other bugs may lead to security
vulnerabilities (which may allow others to "use" your computer in unintended
and unauthorized ways).
When a critical bug is found, the fix will be committed to
the <i>-current</i> source tree, and patches will be released for the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">supported releases</a> of OpenBSD.
These patches appear on the <a href="../errata.html">errata web
page</a>, and are separated into "common" errata that impact
all <a href="../plat.html">platforms</a>, and errata that impact only
one or more, but not all, platforms.

<p>
Note, however, that patches aren't released for new features or
additional hardware support for OpenBSD,
and are only published for important reliability fixes or security problems
that should be addressed right away on impacted systems (which is often
NOT all systems, depending on their purpose).

<p>
There are three ways to update your system with patched code:

<ul>
<li><b>Upgrade your system to
<a href="current.html"><i>-current</i></a>.</b>
As all fixes are applied to the <i>-current</i> code base, updating your
system to the latest snapshot is a very good way to apply fixed code.
However, running <i>-current</i> is not for everyone.
<li><b>Update your system to <a href="../stable.html"><i>-stable</i></a>.</b>
This is done by fetching or updating your source tree using the appropriate
<i>-stable</i> branch, and recompiling the kernel and userland files.
Overall, this is probably the easiest way, though it takes longer (as the 
entire system gets recompiled) and a complete source checkout can take a 
long time if you have limited bandwidth available.
<li><b>Patch, compile and install individual impacted files.</b>
This is what we will use for our example below.
While this requires less bandwidth and typically less time than an entire 
cvs(1) checkout/update and source code compilation, this is sometimes
the most difficult option, as there is no one universal set of
instructions to follow.
Sometimes you must patch, recompile and install one application, other 
times, you might have to recompile entire sections of the tree if the 
problem is in a library file.
</ul>

Again, patching individual files is not always simple, so give serious
thought to following the <a href="../stable.html"><i>-stable</i></a> (or
"patch") branch of OpenBSD.
Mixing and matching of patching solutions can be done if you understand
how everything works, but new users should pick one method and stick with 
it.

<h3>How are "errata" patches different from what is in the CVS tree?</h3>

<p>
All patches posted to the
<a href="../errata.html">errata web page</a> are patches
directly against the indicated release's source tree. Patches against the
latest CVS tree might also include other changes that wouldn't be wanted
on a release system.
This is important: If you have installed a snapshot, checked out the source
trees at the time you obtained that snapshot and attempt to patch it using a 
published patch, you may well find the patch doesn't apply, as that code 
may have changed.



<h3>Applying patches.</h3>

<p>
Patches for OpenBSD are distributed as unified diffs, which
are text files that hold differences to the original source code.
They are <b>NOT</b> distributed in binary form.
This means that to apply a patch you must have the source code
from the <b>RELEASE</b> version of your system available.
In general, it is advisable to acquire the entire source tree before applying
a patch.
If you are running a release from an official CDROM, the source trees are 
available as files on disk 3, and these can also be downloaded from the
<a href="../ftp.html">FTP servers</a>.
We will assume you have the entire tree checked out.

<p>
For our example here, we will look at patch 011 for OpenBSD 5.6, dealing with 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man4/pppoe.4">pppoe(4)</a>
connections.
Without this patch, MAC addresses could get corrupted.
People using PPPOE <i>needed</i> this patch, however those who
didn't may have had no particular need to install it.
Let's look at the patch:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>more 011_pppoe.patch.sig</b>
Apply patch using:

    signify -Vep /etc/signify/openbsd-56-base.pub -x 011_pppoe.patch.sig \
        -m - | (cd /usr/src && patch -p0)

Then build and install a new kernel.

As you will note, the top of the patch includes brief instructions on

with the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/signify.1">signify(1)</a> tool.
We will assume you have put this patch into your current working

Hunk #1 succeeded at 673.              <i>&lt;-- Look for this message!</i>
done
</pre></blockquote>

Note the "<tt>Hunk #1 succeeded</tt>" message above.
This indicates the patch was applied successfully.
Many patches are more complex than this one, and will involve multiple
hunks and multiple files, in which case you should verify that all
hunks succeeded on all files.
If they did not, it normally means your source tree was different in
some way from the release source tree the patch was created from, or you
didn't follow instructions carefully, or your patch was mangled.
Patches are very sensitive to "white space" -- copying and pasting from 
your browser will often change tab characters into spaces or otherwise
alter the white space of a file, making it not apply.

<p>
At this point, you can <a href="faq5.html#BldKernel">build and
install</a> the new kernel, then reboot the system as normal.

<p>
Not all patches are for the kernel.
In some cases, you will have to rebuild individual utilities. At other
times, will require recompiling all utilities statically linked to a
patched library.
Follow the guidance in the header of the patch and, if uncertain,
rebuild the entire system.

<p>
Patches that are irrelevant to your particular system need not be
applied -- usually.
For example, if you did not use PPPOE connections on your system, you would
not benefit from the above patch.
However, patches are assumed to be applied "in order" -- it is possible
that a later patch is dependent upon an earlier one.
Be aware of this if you elect to "pick and choose" which patches you
apply, and if in doubt, apply them all in order.

<h2 id="rootshell">10.17 - Can I change the root shell?</h2>
It is sometimes said that one should never change the root shell, though
there is no reason not to in OpenBSD.

<p>
The default shell for <i>root</i> on OpenBSD is 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ksh&amp;sektion=1">ksh</a>.

<p>
A traditional Unix guideline is to only use statically compiled shells
for root, because if your system comes up in single user mode, non-root
partitions won't be mounted and dynamically linked shells won't be able
to access libraries located in the <tt>/usr</tt> partition. This isn't
actually a significant issue for OpenBSD, as the system will prompt you
for a shell when it comes up in single user mode, and the default is
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sh&amp;sektion=1">sh</a>.

The three standard shells in OpenBSD
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=csh&amp;sektion=1">csh</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sh&amp;sektion=1">sh</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ksh&amp;sektion=1">ksh</a>)
are all statically linked, and thus usable in single user mode.

<h2 id="ksh">10.18 - What else can I do with <i>ksh</i>?</h2>
In OpenBSD, 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ksh&amp;sektion=1">ksh</a>
is <a href="http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/pdksh/">pdksh</a>, the Public
Domain Korn Shell, and is the same binary as
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sh&amp;sektion=1">sh</a>.

<p>
Users comfortable with <i>bash</i>, often used on Linux systems, will
probably find
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ksh&amp;sektion=1">ksh</a>
very familiar. Ksh(1) provides most of the commonly used features in
<i>bash</i>, including tab completion, command line editing and history
via the arrow keys, and CTRL-A/CTRL-E to jump to beginning/end of the
command line. If other features of <i>bash</i> are desired, <i>bash</i>
itself can be loaded via either <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">packages</a>
or <a href="faq15.html#Ports">ports</a>.

<p>
The command prompt of <i>ksh</i> can easily be changed to something
providing more information than the default "$ " by setting the
<tt>PS1</tt> variable. For example, inserting the following line:

<blockquote><pre>
export PS1='$PWD $ '
</pre></blockquote>

in your <tt>/etc/profile</tt> produces the following command prompt:

<blockquote><pre>
/home/nick $
</pre></blockquote>

See the file
<a href="http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/etc/ksh.kshrc?content-type=text/plain"><tt>/etc/ksh.kshrc</tt></a>,
which includes many useful features and examples, and may be invoked in
your user's <tt>.profile</tt>.

<p>
OpenBSD's ksh(1) has been enhanced with a number of 
"special characters" for the primary prompt string, PS1, similar to 
those used in bash.
For example:
<blockquote>
<tt>\e - </tt>Insert an ASCII escape character.<br>
<tt>\h - </tt>The hostname, minus domain name.<br>
<tt>\H - </tt>The full hostname, including domain name.<br>
<tt>\n - </tt>Insert a newline character.<br>
<tt>\t - </tt>The current time, in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format.<br>
<tt>\u - </tt>The current user's username.<br>
<tt>\w - </tt>The current working directory.  $HOME is abbreviated as `~'.<br>
<tt>\W - </tt>The basename of the current working directory.<br>
<tt>\$ - </tt>Displays "#" for root users, "$" for non-root users.
</blockquote>

(see the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ksh&amp;sektion=1">ksh(1)</a>
man page for more details, and many, many more special characters!
Also note the "$" character has special meaning inside double quotes, so
handle it carefully)

<p>
One could use the following command:
<blockquote><pre>
export PS1="\n\u@\H\n\w \\$ "
</pre></blockquote>
to give an overly verbose but somewhat useful prompt.

<h2 id="Dir">10.19 - Directory services</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD can be used for both servers and clients of databases containing
user credentials, group information and other network-related data.

<h3 id="Dir.available">10.19.1 - Which directory services are available?</h3>

<p>
Of course, you could use various directory services on OpenBSD.
But YP is the only one that can be accessed directly using standard
C-library functions like
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=getpwent&amp;sektion=3"
>getpwent(3)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=getgrent&amp;sektion=3"
>getgrent(3)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=gethostbyname&amp;sektion=3"
>gethostbyname(3)</a> and so on.
Thus, if you keep your data in a YP database, you do not need
to copy it to local configuration files like
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=master.passwd&amp;sektion=5"
>master.passwd(5)</a> before you can use it,
for example to authenticate system users.

<p>
YP is a directory service compatible with
Sun Microsystems NIS (Network Information System).
See
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=yp&amp;sektion=8">yp(8)</a>
for an overview of the available manual pages.
Be careful, some operating systems contain directory services bearing
similar names but all the same being incompatible, for example NIS+.

<p>
To use other directory services except YP, you either need to populate local
configuration files from the directory, or you need a YP frontend to
the directory.
For example, you can use the <tt>sysutils/login_ldap</tt> port
when you choose the former, while the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ypldap&amp;sektion=8"
>ypldap(8)</a> daemon provides the latter.

<p>
For some applications, simply synchronizing a small number of configuration
files among a group of machines using tools like
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cron&amp;sektion=8"
>cron(8)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scp&amp;sektion=1"
>scp(1)</a> or <tt>rsync</tt> (available from ports) constitutes an easy
and robust alternative to a full-blown directory service.

<h3 id="YP_secure">10.19.2 - YP security considerations</h3>

<p>
For compatibility reasons, all security features built into the OpenBSD
implementation of YP are switched <em>off</em> by default.
Even when they are all switched on, the NIS protocol is still
inherently insecure for two reasons:
All data, including sensitive data like password hashes,
is transmitted unencrypted across the network, and neither the client
nor the server can reliably verify each other's identity.

<p>
Thus, before setting up any YP server, you should consider whether
these inherent security flaws are acceptable in your context.
In particular, YP is inadequate if potential attackers have physical
access to your network.
Anybody gaining root access to any computer connected to your network
segments carrying YP traffic can bind your YP domain and retrieve its data.
In some cases, passing YP traffic through SSL or IPSec tunnels
might be an option.

<h3 id="YP_server">10.19.3 - Setting up a YP server</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>
A YP server serves a group of clients called a "domain".
You should first select a domain name; it can be an arbitrary string
and need not be related in any way to DNS domain names.
Choosing a random name like "Eepoo5vi" can marginally improve security,
though the effect is mostly in security by obscurity.
In case you need to maintain several distinct YP domains,
it's probably better to choose descriptive names like "sales",
"marketing" and "research" in order to forestall system administration
errors caused by obscurity.
Also note that some versions of SunOS require using the host's DNS
domain name, so your choice might be restricted in a network including
such hosts.

<p>
Use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=domainname&amp;sektion=1"
>domainname(1)</a> utility to set the domain name, and put it into the file
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=defaultdomain&amp;sektion=5"
>defaultdomain(5)</a> to have it automatically set at system startup time. 

<blockquote><pre>
echo "puffynet" > /etc/defaultdomain
domainname `cat /etc/defaultdomain`
</pre></blockquote>

<li><p>
Initialise the YP server using the interactive command

<blockquote><pre>
ypinit -m
</pre></blockquote>

At this point, it is not necessary to specify slave servers yet.
To add slave servers, you can rerun
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ypinit&amp;sektion=8"
>ypinit(8)</a> later, using the <tt>-u</tt> option.

Setting up at least one slave server for each domain is useful
to avoid service interruptions, should the master server ever go down
or lose network connectivity, in particular since client processes
trying to access YP maps block indefinitely until they receive the
requested information.  Thus, YP service interruptions typically render
the client hosts completely unusable until YP is back to service.

<li><p>
Decide where to store the source files to generate your YP maps from.
Keeping the server configuration separate from the served configuration
helps to control which information will be served and which won't,
so the default <tt>/etc</tt> often isn't the best choice.

<p>
The only inconvenience caused by changing the source directory
is that you will not be able to add, remove and modify users and groups
in the YP domain using utilities like
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=user&amp;sektion=8"
>user(8)</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=group&amp;sektion=8"
>group(8)</a>.
Instead, you will have to edit the configuration files with a text editor.

<p>
To define the source directory, edit the file
<tt>/var/yp/`domainname`/Makefile</tt>
and change the <tt>DIR</tt> variable, e.g.

<blockquote><pre>
DIR=/etc/yp/src/puffynet
</pre></blockquote>

<li><p>
Consider customizing other variables in
<tt>/var/yp/`domainname`/Makefile</tt>.  See
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=Makefile.yp&amp;sektion=8"
>Makefile.yp(8)</a> for details.

<p>
For example, even in case you use the default source directory <tt>/etc</tt>,
you do not usually need all accounts and groups existing on the server on all
your client hosts.  In particular, not serving the root account and thus
keeping root's password hash confidential is often beneficial to security.
Review the values of <tt>MINUID</tt>, <tt>MAXUID</tt>, <tt>MINGID</tt>
and <tt>MAXGID</tt> and adjust them to you needs.

<p>
If all your YP clients run OpenBSD or FreeBSD, exclude the encrypted
passwords from the <tt>passwd</tt> maps by setting <tt>UNSECURE=""</tt> in
<tt>/var/yp/`domainname`/Makefile</tt>.

<p>
The former practice of editing the template file <tt>/var/yp/Makefile.yp</tt>
is no longer recommended.  Changes to that file affect all domains initialized
after the change, but do not affect domains initialized before the change,
so this is error-prone either way: You both risk that the intended changes
do not take effect, and you risk to forget about them and have them affect
other domains later which they were never intended for.

<li><p>
Create the source directory and populate it with the configuration files
you need.  See
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=Makefile.yp&amp;sektion=8"
>Makefile.yp(8)</a> to learn which YP maps require which source files.
For the format of the individual configuration files, refer to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=passwd&amp;sektion=5"
>passwd(5)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=group&amp;sektion=5"
>group(5)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hosts&amp;sektion=5"
>hosts(5)</a> and so on, and look at the examples in <tt>/etc</tt>.

<li><p>
Create the initial version of your YP maps using the commands

<blockquote><pre>
cd /var/yp
make
</pre></blockquote>

Do not worry about error messages from
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=yppush&amp;sektion=8"
>yppush(8)</a> right now.
The YP server is not yet running.

<li><p>
YP uses
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rpc&amp;sektion=3"
>rpc(3)</a> (remote procedure calls) to communicate with clients,
so it is necessary to enable
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=portmap&amp;sektion=8"
>portmap(8)</a>.
To do so, edit
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc.conf.local&amp;sektion=8"
>rc.conf.local(8)</a> and set <tt>portmap_flags=""</tt>.
This will start the portmapper on next boot.
You can avoid rebooting by also starting it manually:

<blockquote><pre>
echo 'portmap_flags=""' >> /etc/rc.conf.local
portmap
</pre></blockquote>

<li><p>
Consider using either the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=securenet&amp;sektion=5"
>securenet(5)</a> or the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ypserv.acl&amp;sektion=5"
>ypserv.acl(5)</a> security feature of the YP server daemon.
But be aware that both of these only provide IP based access control.
Thus, they only help as long as potential attackers have neither physical
access to the hardware of the network segments carrying your YP traffic
nor root access to any host connected to those network segments.

<li><p>
Finally, start the YP server daemon:

<blockquote><pre>
ypserv
</pre></blockquote>

It will automatically be restarted at boot time as long as the directory
<tt>/var/yp/`domainname`</tt> continues to exist.

<li><p>
To test the new server, consider making it its own client,
following the instructions in the first part of the next section.
In case you don't want the server to use its own maps, you can
disable the client part after the test with the following commands:

<blockquote><pre>
pkill ypbind
rm -rf /var/yp/binding
</pre></blockquote>

<li><p>
If you wish to allow users to change their passwords from client machines,
then you must enable
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=yppasswdd&amp;sektion=8"
>yppasswdd(8)</a>:

<blockquote><pre>
echo 'yppasswdd_flags="-d /etc/yp/src/puffynet"' >> /etc/rc.conf.local
rpc.yppasswdd
</pre></blockquote>

In case you left the source directory at the default <tt>/etc</tt>,
just use <tt>yppasswdd_flags=""</tt>.

<li><p>
Remember that each time you change a file sourced by a YP map,
you must regenerate your YP maps.

<blockquote><pre>
cd /var/yp
make
</pre></blockquote>

This updates all database files in <tt>/var/yp/`domainname`</tt>, with
one exception:  The file <tt>ypservers.db</tt>, listing all YP master
and slave servers associated with the domain, is created directly
from <tt>ypinit -m</tt> and modified exclusively by <tt>ypinit -u</tt>.
In case you accidentally delete it, run <tt>ypinit -u</tt> to recreate
it from scratch.
</ol>

<h3 id="YP_client">10.19.4 - Setting up a YP client</h3>

Setting up a YP client involves two distinct parts.
First, you must get the YP client daemon running,
binding your client host to a YP server.
Completing the following steps will allow you to retrieve data
from the YP server, but that data will not yet be used by the system:

<ol>
<li><p>
Like on the server, you must set the domain name and enable the portmapper:

<blockquote><pre>
echo "puffynet" > /etc/defaultdomain
domainname `cat /etc/defaultdomain`
echo 'portmap_flags=""' >> /etc/rc.conf.local
portmap
</pre></blockquote>

<li><p>
It is recommended to provide a list of YP servers in the configuration
file <tt>/etc/yp/`domainname`</tt>.
Otherwise, the YP client daemon will use network broadcasts to find
YP servers for its domain.
Explicitly specifying the servers is both more robust and marginally
less open to attack.
If you have not set up any slave servers, just put the host name
of the master server into <tt>/etc/yp/`domainname`</tt>.

<li><p>
The YP client daemon is called
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ypbind&amp;sektion=8"
>ypbind(8)</a>.
Starting it manually will create the directory <tt>/var/yp/binding</tt>,
such that it will be automatically restarted at boot time.

<blockquote><pre>
ypbind
</pre></blockquote>

<li><p>
If all went well you should be able to query the YP server using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ypcat&amp;sektion=1"
>ypcat(1)</a> and see your passwd map returned.

<blockquote><pre>
ypcat passwd
bob:*:5001:5000:Bob Nuggets:/home/bob:/usr/local/bin/zsh
...
</pre></blockquote>

Other useful tools for debugging your YP setup include
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ypmatch&amp;sektion=1"
>ypmatch(1)</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=yptest&amp;sektion=8"
>yptest(8)</a>.
</ol>

The second part of configuring a YP client
involves editing local configuration files
such that certain YP maps get used by various system facilities.
Not all servers serve all standard maps supported by the operating system,
some servers serve additional non-standard maps,
and you are by no means compelled to use all those maps.
Which of the available maps shall or shall not be used,
and for which purposes they shall be used, is fully at the discretion
of the client host's system administrator.

<p>
For a list of standard YP maps and their standard usage, see
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=Makefile.yp&amp;sektion=8"
>Makefile.yp(8)</a>.
The most common use cases include:

<ul>
<li><p>
If you want to include all user accounts from the YP domain,
append the default YP marker to the master password file and rebuild
the password database:

<blockquote><pre>
echo '+:*::::::::' >> /etc/master.passwd
pwd_mkdb -p /etc/master.passwd
</pre></blockquote>

For details on selective inclusion and exclusion of user accounts, see
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=passwd&amp;sektion=5"
>passwd(5)</a>.
To test whether inclusion actually works, use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=id&amp;sektion=1"
>id(1)</a> utility.

<li><p>
If you want to include all groups from the YP domain,
append the default YP marker to the group file:

<blockquote><pre>
echo '+:*::' >> /etc/group
</pre></blockquote>

For details on selective group inclusion, see
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=group&amp;sektion=5"
>group(5)</a>.

<li><p>
If you are distributing hostnames via YP, you should now review
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=resolv.conf&amp;sektion=5"
>resolv.conf(5)</a> and check that the name service lookup order is correct.
Most users will require a line like this:

<blockquote><pre>
lookup file yp bind
</pre></blockquote>
</ul>

<h2 id="locales">10.20 - Character sets and localization</h2>

OpenBSD uses the ASCII character set by default. It also supports
the Latin (ISO-8859-*), KOI-8, and Unicode (UTF-8) character sets.

<h3 id="charset">10.20.1 - Configuring the active character set</h3>

<p>To use one of the extended character sets, the <i>LC_CTYPE</i>
environment variable must be set to the name of a supported locale.
<i>LC_CTYPE</i> will only affect the character set available to applications.
It will not change the language used for application messages.

<p>The list of supported locales can be obtained by running the command:
<blockquote><pre>
locale -a
</pre></blockquote>

The <i>LC_CTYPE</i> environment variable can be set in one of the following ways:

<ul>
<li>If logging in via
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xdm&amp;sektion=1">xdm(1)</a>
add a line such as
<blockquote><pre>
export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
</pre></blockquote>
to <i>~/.xsession</i> before starting the window manager (see the section on
<a href="faq11.html#CustomizingX">customizing X</a> for details).
This example enables the Unicode (UTF-8) character set and will also cause
applications such as
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xterm&amp;sektion=1">xterm(1)</a>
to enable UTF-8 mode by default.

<li><p>If logging in via the text console add a line such as
<blockquote><pre>
export LC_CTYPE="en_US.ISO8859-1"
</pre></blockquote>
to <i>~/.profile</i>.
Note that the text console supports ASCII and ISO8859-1 only.
It does not support UTF-8.
</ul>

<p>Few utilities in the base system support UTF-8 at this time.
Most will use ASCII in the UTF-8 locale.
However, many programs from the ports collection do support UTF-8.

<p>UTF-8 can also be used with specific applications only by starting
those applications in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=uxterm&amp;sektion=1">uxterm(1)</a>.
This works even if the login session uses a non-UTF-8 locale.

<p>When logging into remote systems with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;sektion=1">ssh(1)</a>,
the <i>LC_CTYPE</i> environment variable is not propagated and will need
to be manually set to the same value used by the local terminal.

<h3 id="nls">10.20.2 - Changing the language used in application messages</h3>

<p>The language used for application messages can be changed by setting
the <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> environment variable to the name of a supported locale.
This can be done in the same way as described for <i>LC_CTYPE</i>
<a href="#charset">above</a>. Both <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> and <i>LC_CTYPE</i>
should be set to the same value.

<p>Few utilities in the base system support languages other than English
at this time.
However, many programs from the ports collection support localized
messages in various languages. They will fall back to English if the
desired language is not available.
