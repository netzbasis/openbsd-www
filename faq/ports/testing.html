<h2 id="Introduction">4.1 - Introduction</h2>

    <p>The <a href="../faq15.html#Ports">ports tree</a> is a huge piece
    of work that
    permits OpenBSD users to use third-party programs without wasting time
    patching, configuring and installing each one individually. This work
    is done by a group of volunteers who spend their time porting and testing
    applications across the range of OpenBSD platforms. Many people think
    that they cannot help this process because they do not have enough
    knowledge; this is false because they can help porters work better and
    faster.

<h2 id="How">4.2 - How</h2>

    <p>Testing submitted updates or new ports which are posted on the
    <a href="../../mail.html">ports mailing list</a>. By doing this
    you reduce the latency of commits and also increase the number of ports to
    be committed (many ports are not committed because of lack of testing!).

<h2 id="First">4.3 - First step</h2>

    <p>The ports tree is developed against
    <a href="../../plus.html">OpenBSD-current</a>; there is no guarantee that
    new ports or updates will work correctly on the other branches.
    This means you should upgrade your system and ports tree to -current
    (instructions on how to do this can be found at the
    <a href="../current.html">Following Current</a>) pages.
    It is also recommended that you subscribe to the ports and ports-changes
    <a href="../../mail.html">mailing-lists</a>. This way you will be notified
    about new or updated ports and about changes in the ports tree.

<h2 id="Testing">4.4 - Testing</h2>

    <p>There are two types of submissions on the mailing-lists; new ports
    and updates. New ports are generally posted as tarball attachments
    or URLs. A good idea is to extract them into the
    <tt>/usr/ports/mystuff/</tt> directory and test from there.
    Updates are generally a diff against the -current ports tree, so it is best
    to copy the port to <tt>mystuff/</tt> and apply the diff to prevent tree
    breakage. If the previous version of the port is installed, it is a
    good idea to remove it before building the newer version to avoid side
    effects, like symbols missing from the older version of a library.

    <p>Step-by-step building is needed to verify that every target, see
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=ports&amp;sektion=7&amp;">
    ports(7)</a>, is achieved correctly :

    <ul>
      <li><i>fetch</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Needed to verify that distfile(s) are correctly downloaded. Try
         to test all of the <tt>MASTER_SITES</tt> specified to make sure they
         are all valid sources.
        </ul>

      <li><i>checksum</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Verify that downloaded distfiles match the checksums recorded
         in the <tt>distinfo</tt> file.
         To download the distfiles from all defined sources and to check their
         checksum you can run this command line from within the directory of
         the port:
         <blockquote><pre>
$ <b>for ms in $(make show=MASTER_SITES); do make clean=dist; make fetch checksum MASTER_SITES=$ms; done</b>
         </pre></blockquote>
        </ul>

      <li><i>extract</i>
        <ul>
         <li>The <tt>prepare</tt> target is automatically invoked before
         <tt>extract</tt> and should install all <tt>{BUILD,LIB}_DEPENDS</tt> for
         this port (such as bzip2).
        </ul>

      <li><i>patch</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Patches should apply cleanly without any warnings.
         <li>There shouldn't be any <tt>.orig</tt> files left behind in the
             <tt>patches/</tt> directory.
         <li>Another common mistake is to include RCS tags in a patch; this
         will break when the port is checked into the repository and the RCS
         tag expanded.
        </ul>

      <li><i>configure</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Check that configure scripts correctly detect features
             on your platform.
         <li>The configure script should not detect stray applications already
             installed on your system without explicit dependencies being
             set in the port.
         <li>If the port does not build with the libtool from base, you can try
            setting <tt>USE_LIBTOOL=gnu</tt> which uses a patched version from
            ports.
            GNU libtool is notorious for undesired 'features' on OpenBSD, so
            if the port does not build with the libtool from base, that should
            be fixed and there should be a XXX comment about why in the ports
            <tt>Makefile</tt>.
         <li>If the port uses CMake and you see undesired results of configure
             stage, make sure to check or send the following files additionally:
             <ul>
                 <li><tt>${WRKBUILD}/CMakeCache.txt</tt>
                 <li><tt>${WRKBUILD}/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log</tt>
                 <li><tt>${WRKBUILD}/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log</tt>
             </ul>
        </ul>

      <li><i>build</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Check for build errors and suspicious warnings.
         <li>Warnings about <a href=
      "http://man.openbsd.org/?query=tmpnam&amp;sektion=3&amp;">
      tmpnam(3)</a> issues should be resolved by using
      <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=mkstemp&amp;sektion=3&amp;">
          mkstemp(3)</a>.
         <li>Try to set the <tt>SEPARATE_BUILD</tt> variable to 'Yes' and test
         if the build still works.
         <li>Make sure dependencies on GNU make are really necessary.
        </ul>

      <li><i>test</i>
        <ul>
          <li>Check for errors (empty tests means okay).
          <li>If the tests have dependencies other than specified in
          <tt>{BUILD,RUN}_DEPENDS</tt>, check that <tt>TEST_DEPENDS</tt> is
          defined correctly.
        </ul>


      <li><i>fake</i>
        <ul>
         <li>This target installs the application into a fake working
         directory, to ensure that all files can be easily packaged up
         without affecting the base system.
         <li>The port should <b>never</b> install files outside of the
         fake directory (such as into <tt>/usr/local</tt>).
         This kind of mistake can be easily caught by using
         <tt>USE_SYSTRACE=Yes</tt>.
         <li>GNU libtool occasionally has trouble relinking libraries
         during the fake process on some architectures.
         <li>Check whether all files get installed with correct ownerships
         and permissions.
        </ul>

      <li><i>port-lib-depends-check</i>
        <ul>
         <li>This will check whether all libraries on which the port depends
         can be reached through either <tt>LIB_DEPENDS</tt> or <tt>WANTLIB</tt>.
         The result should be empty. The above variables should be inspected
         when you see lines starting "Extra" or "Missing".
        </ul>

      <li><i>package</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Package creation can break if <tt>pkg/PLIST*</tt> and/or
         <tt>pkg/PFRAG*</tt> are wrong.
        </ul>

      <li><i>install</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Packages should install all of the files from their packaging
         lists successfully and with the correct permissions.  Be especially
         careful of files with the setuid bits set.
         <li>Make sure that the package <tt>INSTALL</tt> script works
         correctly, and does not overwrite any files in <tt>/etc</tt>.
        </ul>

      <li><i>deinstall</i>
        <ul>
         <li>This should remove all files installed by the package, except
         those in <tt>/etc</tt>.
         <li>System files created by the package at runtime should be
         marked with <tt>@extra</tt> and/or <tt>@extraunexec</tt> annotations
         in <tt>pkg/PLIST*</tt>.
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>Remaining <tt>pkg/</tt> files like <tt>DESCR</tt> and <tt>MESSAGE</tt>
    should be checked for grammar and typos.
    Paragraphs should be formatted using
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=fmt&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">fmt(1)</a>
    and wrapped at 80 characters.

<h2 id="Commenting">4.5 - Commenting</h2>

    <p>At the end of the test comes the really important thing : comments.
    Even if the port is working fine comments must be done. If we have ten
    posts where people say that the port runs fine under different architectures
    then the commit is done faster. If it does not work then some information
    must be given.
    There are tools that can help in this task, like portslogger(1) which is like
    an "intelligent tee" that redirects output into a log file.

    <p>Example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>make install 2&gt;&amp;1 | /usr/ports/infrastructure/bin/portslogger .</b>
</pre></blockquote>

    <p>This will redirect the output into a log file located in the current
    directory.

    <p>Finally, once the port is found to be okay, other ports depending on
    it should also be tested, to check whether they are still working
    correctly. The <tt>show-required-by</tt> make target will help to find
    other ports which depend on the current one.

<h2 id="More">4.6 - More testing</h2>

    <p>Check the port's <tt>Makefile</tt> for correct dependencies, typos,
    incorrect links, useless or missing variables, correct licensing and
    categories.
    Those who are more skilled can help by examining patches, as well as
    providing diffs to correct bugs, add flavors, or other enhancements.

    <p>These diffs should be done with the <tt>-uNprx CVS</tt> options.
    <tt>cvs diff -uNp</tt> can also be used to generate patches against
    the CVS repository.</p>
