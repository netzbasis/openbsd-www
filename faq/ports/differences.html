<h2 id="Extra">Extra Support</h2>

The porting infrastructure includes several scripts under
<tt>infrastructure/bin</tt> that facilitate the creation of new ports:

<dl>
<dt>check-lib-depends
    <dd>invoked through <tt>make lib-depends-check</tt>, to verify shared
    libraries dependencies.
<dt>update-patches
    <dd>invoked through <tt>make update-patches</tt>, which should
    <b>always</b> be used to regenerate patches.
<dt>make-plist
    <dd>invoked through <tt>make update-plist</tt>.
    This takes care of most of the finest points of crafting accurate
    packing-lists.
    OpenBSD packing-lists are significantly different from those of other
    BSD projects, in part because the package tools have been completely
    rewritten.
</dl>

Check the <tt>infrastructure/bin</tt> directory for more useful scripts.
Most of them are documented under <tt>infrastructure/man</tt>.

<h2 id="Generic">Generic Infrastructure Issues</h2>

OpenBSD's <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/make">make(1)</a> supports
<tt>${VAR:U}</tt> and <tt>${VAR:L}</tt> to transform a variable's value
into uppercase or lowercase. Accordingly, make tests should be coded in
a case-independent way.
For example:

<pre class="cmdbox">
.if ${NEED_XXX:L} == "yes"
do stuff if yes
.else
do other stuff
.endif
</pre>

In theory, all boolean variables recognized by <tt>bsd.port.mk</tt> should
always be defined, so that code like <tt>defined(USE_FOO)</tt> should not
be necessary, and <tt>${USE_FOO:L} != "no"</tt> ought to work.

<p>
The main <tt>bsd.port.mk</tt> file has been heavily streamlined and fixed.
In particular, it is parallel-make ready.
The <tt>scripts/{pre,do,post}-*</tt> feature has been lost in the process.
To replace that feature, invoke the script manually from the <tt>Makefile</tt>.

<h2 id="Make">Using make Properly</h2>

Note that if you invoke make as <tt><b>make VAR=value</b></tt>, the assignment
will override whatever value <tt>VAR</tt> may get from the <tt>Makefile</tt>.
This means that many <tt>Makefile</tt> patches are not necessary.
It is much better to set <tt>MAKE_FLAGS</tt> correctly, which decreases the
maintenance burden.

<h2 id="Fetch">Fetching Sources</h2>

There are two kinds of source archives: <tt>DISTFILES</tt> and
<tt>PATCHFILES</tt>.
OpenBSD processes them in a uniform way and retrieves everything from
<tt>MASTER_SITES</tt> by default.
There are <b>no</b> <tt>PATCH_SITES</tt> nor <tt>PATCH_SITES_SUBDIR</tt>.

<p>
If all files to fetch don't come from the same set of sites, OpenBSD allows
the extension <tt>filename:0</tt> to <tt>filename:9</tt>, in which case it
will use <tt>MASTER_SITES0</tt> to <tt>MASTER_SITES9</tt> to retrieve the file.

<p>
Some architectures may need specific distfiles.
In the past, this has caused trouble where mirroring distfiles was concerned.
OpenBSD supports a third set of files: <tt>SUPDISTFILES</tt>.
Those will be considered only for creating checksums and mirroring purposes.
Note that <tt>SUPDISTFILES</tt> may have an overlap with <tt>DISTFILES</tt> or
<tt>PATCHFILES</tt>.
For instance:

<pre class="cmdbox">
DISTFILES=foo-1.0.tgz
.if ${ARCH} == "i386"
DISTFILES+=foo-i386.tgz
.elif ${ARCHI} == "amd64"
DISTFILES+=foo-amd64.tgz
.endif
SUPDISTFILES=foo-i386.tgz foo-amd64.tgz
</pre>

<h2 id="wrkdir">The <tt>WRKDIR</tt> Infrastructure</h2>

We don't want ports that use <tt>NO_WRKDIR</tt>.
All OpenBSD ports must have a work directory.
Naming details of those work directories should not be a porter's concerns.
If you need to find out about such a name, ask the <tt>Makefile</tt>:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>cd that_ports_dir &amp;&amp; make show=WRKDIR</b>
</pre>

This will yield that port's idea of <tt>WRKDIR</tt>.

<p>
The main reason behind this prohibition is that OpenBSD's <tt>bsd.port.mk</tt>
acts like a real <tt>Makefile</tt>, with dependencies.
The <tt>fetch</tt> stage depends upon the distfiles and patchfiles, and all
other stages depend on real files living in the working directory (cookies),
so they can't exist without a working directory.

<p>
If the <tt>DISTFILES</tt> extraction is special, set

<pre class="cmdbox">
EXTRACT_ONLY=
</pre>

and do the extraction in <tt>post-extract.</tt>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>WRKDIR</tt></dt>

<dd>The port working directory, where it puts its own cookies.</dd>

<dt><tt>WRKDIST</tt></dt>

<dd>Subdirectory of <tt>WRKDIR</tt> where the port actually unpacks.
It is also the base directory for patch.
Other BSDs currently don't have the <tt>WRKDIST/WRKSRC</tt> distinction and
have only <tt>WRKSRC</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>WRKSRC</tt></dt>

<dd>Subdirectory of <tt>WRKDIST</tt> where the actual source lives.</dd>

<dt><tt>WRKBUILD</tt></dt>

<dd>Subdirectory of <tt>WRKDIR</tt> where the port configure and build will
occur.
Other BSDs don't have the <tt>WRKBUILD/WRKSRC</tt> distinction.
Programs based on autoconf (mostly) can usually set <tt>SEPARATE_BUILD</tt>
to let the port build happen in a <tt>WRKBUILD</tt> distinct from
<tt>WRKSRC</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>WRKCONF</tt></dt>

<dd>Subdirectory of <tt>WRKDIR</tt> where configure scripts should be run.
Defaults to <tt>WRKBUILD</tt>, which is correct 99% of the time.</dd>

<dt><tt>WRKINST</tt></dt>

<dd>Directory where the port will be installed before being packaged (see
"faking ports" below).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<i>Note that <tt>NO_WRKSUBDIR</tt> has been removed: its functionality can be
achieved by setting <tt>WRKDIST=$(WRKDIR)</tt> instead. </i>

<h2 id="Fake">Fake Port Installation</h2>

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>

After a build is complete, other BSDs proceed to install a port, then build
a package from the installed port.
OpenBSD uses faked installation instead.

<ul>
<li>An OpenBSD port is configured and built normally (e.g., to install under
<tt>PREFIX</tt>, usually <tt>/usr/local</tt>).

<li>But it's told to install elsewhere, namely under <tt>WRKINST</tt>, which
is usually a subdirectory of <tt>WRKDIR</tt>.

<li>Then the false installation is packaged, using the <tt>-B</tt> option of
pkg_create.

<li>Finally, the resulting package can be installed, using pkg_add.
</ul>

<h3 id="Advantages">Advantages</h3>

<ul>
<li>For a package builder, it means that most ports don't have to actually be
installed, which removes a large number of potential compromises and general
nastiness from badly-installed ports.
It also allows building several conflicting packages on the same machine.
Finally, it allows building a new set of untested packages without hosing
a correct installation.

<li>For a port writer, it greatly simplifies the task of finding problems in
packing lists, since the fake area of installation is empty before the port
gets installed.
Also, if a port installs too many files, it is no longer necessary to tweak
the port installation: it is enough not to record the extraneous files in
the packing list.

<li>For the end user, it improves the quality of packages: since the final
port is installed using pkg_add, the end user gets <i>exactly</i> the same
software that was prepared on the porter's machine.
</ul>

<h3 id="How">How to do it</h3>

The targets invoked for <tt><b>make fake</b></tt> are the usual install
targets, except for a few differences:

<ul>
<li><tt>FAKE_FLAGS</tt> is used instead of <tt>MAKE_FLAGS</tt>.
By default, <tt>FAKE_FLAGS</tt> sets <tt>DESTDIR=${WRKINST}</tt>.

<li><tt>FAKE_TARGET</tt> is used instead of <tt>INSTALL_TARGET</tt>.

<li>The <tt>{pre,do,post}-install</tt> fragments are invoked with
<tt>TRUEPREFIX</tt> set to <tt>$(PREFIX)</tt>, <tt>PREFIX</tt> set to
<tt>$(WRKINST)$(PREFIX)</tt>, and <tt>DESTDIR</tt> set to <tt>$(WRKINST)</tt>.
</ul>

<p>
Ports using imake should work as is, since the imake fragments are configured
to use <tt>DESTDIR</tt>.
Similarly, recent GNU configure ports should need no change.

<p>
Another good technique is a "late binding" trick: configure the ports to use
a prefix of <tt>$(DESTDIR)/usr/local</tt>, so that the resulting
<tt>Makefile</tt> has the following set:

<pre class="cmdbox">
prefix=$(DESTDIR)/usr/local
</pre>

When the port gets built, since <tt>DESTDIR</tt> is set to nothing,
<tt>/usr/local</tt> is used.
The fake install will put everything into <tt>${WRKINST}/usr/local</tt>
(e.g., for GNU configure, use <tt>CONFIGURE_STYLE= gnu dest</tt>).

<h3 id="Pitfalls">Pitfalls</h3>

<ul>
<li>Some ports are inconsistent in their <tt>DESTDIR</tt> processing: most
of the port is happy with <tt>DESTDIR</tt> set, except for one or two
offenders.
Patch the problem away.

<li>Be careful to distinguish between the actual location where the port is
installed, and the location recorded in the configuration files of the package.
This is very easy to overlook, but easy to fix using <tt>TRUEPREFIX</tt>.

<li>Absolute symlinks always need to be tweaked.
Luckily, <tt>bsd.port.mk</tt> will notice problems in that area.

<li>A few ports don't want to leave <tt>$(DESTDIR)</tt> alone at the configure
stage.
A <tt>post-configure</tt> fragment that tweaks all Makefiles to add the
<tt>DESTDIR</tt> is needed.

<li>Very seldom, a port will resist all reasonable attempts to use FAKE.
A brute force approach should work: use <tt>pre-fake</tt> to link or copy
everything the port wants to find in the <tt>WRKINST</tt> area, then perform
the install under chroot.
</ul>

<h2 id="Tools">Packaging Tools</h2>

The package tools know about quite a few file types and can do a lot of things
automatically: in most cases <tt>@exec</tt> commands or <tt>INSTALL</tt>
scripts are unneeded.

<p>
Note that all unneeded scripts should be banned, as they have scalability
issues.
It is much easier to debug one single package infrastructure than to modify
hundreds of scripts to handle new problems.
For instance:

<ul>
<li><tt>@exec ldconfig</tt> is not needed, as shared libraries are
annotated with <tt>@lib libfoo.so.1.0</tt> and <tt>ldconfig</tt>
runs only when needed, and handles chroot gracefully.
<li><tt>@exec install-info</tt> is not needed, as info documentation
files are annotated with <tt>@info file.info</tt>.
This also takes care of multiple info files, and removes the need for
<tt><b>makeinfo --no-split</b></tt>.
<li>fonts get integrated automatically thanks to <tt>@font</tt> and
<tt>@fontdir</tt>.
<li>New users and groups get handled with <tt>@newuser</tt> and
<tt>@newgroup</tt> instead of installation scripts.
They also get created early enough so that further package extraction can
use them.
<li>Configuration files are handled through <tt>@sample</tt> instead
of installation scripts.
</ul>

<p>
Refer to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_create">pkg_create(1)</a> for
more details.
In most cases, <tt><b>make update-plist</b></tt> will write a very good
approximation of a complete packing-list, and will carry hand-made tweaks
from one version to the next.

<h2 id="Flavors">Flavors</h2>

Options have been rationalized as flavors, so that package building can be
consistent.
A port with options should set <tt>FLAVORS</tt> to the list of all options that
make sense for that port (e.g., <tt>FLAVORS=foo bar zoinx</tt>), then use
<tt>FLAVOR</tt> to test what options have actually been selected (e.g.,
<tt>FLAVOR=zoinx foo</tt>).
<tt>bsd.port.mk</tt> provides some support:

<ul>
<li>The <tt>PKGNAME</tt> is tweaked to include dash separated options (e.g.,
<tt>package-foo-zoinx</tt>).

<li>The <tt>WRKDIR</tt> is tweaked so that distinct flavors can be built
concurrently without colliding.

<li>Constructs of the form <tt>%%flavor%%</tt> will trigger the inclusion of
<tt>PFRAG.flavor</tt>.

<li><tt>bsd.port.subdir.mk</tt> understands the extension
<tt>SUBDIR=directory,opt1,opt2</tt> to say "build port in <tt>directory</tt>
with <tt>FLAVOR=opt1 opt2</tt>."
</ul>

<p>
Checking that a given flavor has been selected is as simple as:

<pre class="cmdbox">
.if ${FLAVOR:L:Mzoinx}
</pre>

There is an extra extension, known as <tt>MULTI_PACKAGES</tt>.
Generally speaking, <tt>MULTI_PACKAGES</tt> and <tt>FLAVORS</tt> are orthogonal
mechanisms.
Together, they account for OpenBSD ports tree being somewhat smaller than the
other BSDs, as they allow one single port directory to build lots of distinct
packages.
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bsd.port.mk">bsd.port.mk(5)</a> has <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bsd.port.mk#FLAVORS_AND_MULTI_PACKAGES">a full
section</a> devoted to FLAVORS AND MULTI_PACKAGES.
