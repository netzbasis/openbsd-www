<p>

Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.
Active development sometimes pushes aggressive changes, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
In general, it's far better to use the
<!-- XXXrelease -->
<a href="upgrade62.html">OpenBSD upgrade procedure</a>
with a newer snapshot, as developers will have gone through much of the trouble
for you already.

<p>
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a>
before using -current and the instructions below.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
<i>-current</i>.
Upgrading by compiling your own source code is not supported.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20171019">2017/10/19 - [packages] neomutt binary renamed</h3>

In neomutt releases since 20171013, binaries and other files have been renamed 
so that they can coexist with mutt.
Users may wish to add a shell alias or a symlink for <tt>mutt -> neomutt</tt>.


<h3 id="r20171023">2017/10/23 - libpthread-stubs removed</h3>

With the integration of the pthread stub functions in libc,
libpthread-stubs is no longer needed in xenocara.
After upgrading base and packages, users may want to remove the old
installed library, either via the sysclean package or by running
the following commands:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/X11R6/lib</b>
# <b>rm libpthread-stubs.a \
     libpthread-stubs.so.2.0 \
     pkgconfig/pthread-stubs.pc</b>
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20171029">2017/10/29 - vmd(8): switch configuration</h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd">vmd(8)</a> no longer automatically
creates an underlying bridge interface for virtual switches defined in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a>.
This will require users to create their bridges ahead of time, e.g.
using <tt>/etc/hostname.bridge0</tt>.
This also requires users to modify their
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a> files to add an
interface line to the switch definition, for example:

<blockquote><pre>
switch "uplink" {
    interface bridge0
}
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20171105">2017/11/05 - make room in <tt>/usr/share</tt> before upgrading</h3>

The relinking of libraries and kernels at boot time now happens in new directory
<tt>/usr/share/relink</tt>.
If you have little room left on the filesystem containing <tt>/usr/share</tt>,
you may want to run

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rm -r /usr/share/compile</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<b>before</b> rebooting into <tt>bsd.rd</tt>.


<h3 id="r20171108">2017/11/08 - iked(8) and isakmpd(8): ECP group incompatibility</h3>

In the final RFC 5903, the computation for the DH shared secret changed.
The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked">iked(8)</a> and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd">isakmpd(8)</a>
programs were modified to follow the RFC.
These changes are not backwards compatible, so if you are using ECP groups,
please make sure to upgrade all peers at the same time.


<h3 id="r20171117">2017/11/17 - <tt>ifconfig &lt;if&gt; deletetunnel</tt> option deprecated</h3>

The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a>
<tt>deletetunnel</tt> option has been replaced by <tt>-tunnel</tt>.
Adjust your <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if">hostname.if(5)</a>
configuration and scripts accordingly.


<h3 id="r20171130">2017/11/30 - [packages] PostgreSQL major update</h3>

There was a major update to PostgreSQL 10.1.
Use <tt>pg_upgrade</tt> as described in the
<a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/ports/databases/postgresql/pkg/README-server?rev=1.23&amp;content-type=text/plain">postgresql-server pkg-readme</a>
or do a dump/restore.


<h3 id="r20171205">2017/12/05 - __cxa_thread_atexit implementation</h3>

This implementation requires an up-to-date
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so">ld.so(1)</a> to be installed
before building any libraries.
To update from source, the following steps are needed:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src && make includes</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src/libexec/ld.so</b>
# <b>make obj</b>
# <b>make</b>
# <b>make install</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Then build userland as normal.


<h3 id="r20171206">2017/12/05 - [xenocara] New default setup for touchpads</h3>

X selects <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ws">ws(4)</a> as default driver for
touchpads now.
In the setup with ws, touchpad-specific input processing is done by
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wsmouse">wsmouse(4)</a>.
Touchpad configuration parameters are made available in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wsconsctl">wsconsctl(8)</a>.
Using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/synaptics">synaptics(4)</a> as input
driver is still possible.
It will require a custom <tt>xorg.conf</tt> file.


<h3 id="r20171218">2017/12/18 - [packages] Buildbot major update</h3>

There was a major update to Buildbot 0.9.
While the buildslave (renamed to buildworker) workdir is compatible between 0.8
and 0.9, this is not the case for the buildmaster.
On top of this, a 0.9 buildworker
<a href="http://docs.buildbot.net/latest/manual/worker-transition.html#buildbot-worker">won't work</a>
with a 0.8 buildmaster.

<p>
Refer to
<a href="http://docs.buildbot.net/current/manual/installation/nine-upgrade.html">the upgrade guide</a>
for information on how to migrate your configuration.
If you want to keep running a 0.8 buildmaster to keep access to your old build
logs/history, it's advised to install the 0.8 branch from <tt>pip</tt> and run
it outside of packages.


<h3 id="r20180119">2018/01/19 - armv7: switch to clang</h3>

The default compiler on the armv7 architecture is now clang.
To update from source, the following steps are needed:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install</b>
# <b>ln -f /usr/bin/clang /usr/bin/cc</b>
# <b>ln -f /usr/bin/clang++ /usr/bin/c++</b>
# <b>ln -f /usr/bin/clang-cpp /usr/libexec/cpp</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Then build kernel and userland as usual.
Some ports may fail to run until they are updated.


<h3 id="r20180210">2018/02/10 - RFC 7217 style IPv6 addresses enabled
by default</h3>

These addresses remain the same after rebooting but change between subnets.

<p>
If you need the old style stateless address calculated from the layer
2 address (i.e. ethernet mac address) put <tt>-soii</tt> into the
<tt>/etc/hostname.if</tt> file.


<h3 id="r20180218">2018/02/17 - [packages] newsbeuter has been removed</h3>

Upgrading newsbeuter using <tt>pkg_add</tt> will result in newsboat being
installed.
Upon running <tt>newsboat</tt> for the first time it will prompt
if it should import an existing newsbeuter configuration.


<h3 id="r20180226">2018/02/26 - [packages] memcached defaults to localhost only</h3>

memcached's documentation says, "you must not expose memcached directly
to the internet, or otherwise any untrusted users".
In order to provide sane defaults, the normal command line in memcached's
rc script has been changed to listen on localhost only.
See the pkg-readme file for information about changing this to listen to
external network traffic if this is required.
