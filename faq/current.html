Following -current and using snapshots

<hr>

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20191106">2019/11/06 - unwind(8): configuration syntax change</h3>
<em>asr</em> has been renamed to <em>stub</em> in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.conf.5">unwind.conf(5).</a>


<h3 id="r20191115">2019/11/15 - rpki-client(8) reuses the
<code>named</code> uid/gid</h3>

The new <code>_rpki-client</code> user recycles the user and group ids
of the "named" daemon user (<code>named</code>, uid/gid 70) which was
removed in 2014.  If you upgraded your system from all the way back
then and never deleted the user and group, delete them and the
<code>/var/named</code> directory:
   
<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>userdel named</b>
# <b>groupdel named</b>
# <b>rm -rf /var/named  # backup the data if still needed</b><!--
--></pre>

If you do not delete them before upgrading,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge">sysmerge(8)</a>
will fail and will need to be re-run manually after deleting them.


<h3 id="r20191127">2019/11/27 - unwind(8) no longer uses http to detect captive portals</h3>
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind">unwind(8)</a> uses a DNS based
heuristic to detect captive portals.
Existing <code>captive portal</code> sections must be removed from
<code>/etc/unwind.conf</code>.


<h3 id="r20191217b">2019/12/17 - usb(4) and uhid(4) changes</h3>

The default permissions of the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/usb.4">usb(4)</a> and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/uhid.4">uhid(4)</a> 
device nodes have been changed by restricting read-write access to the
root user.  Run <code>MAKEDEV</code> to update the device nodes manually:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cd /dev</b>
# <b>sh MAKEDEV all</b><!--
--></pre>

<p>
Access to FIDO/U2F security keys is now provided by the 
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fido.4">fido(4)</a> driver instead of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/uhid.4">uhid(4)</a>.
Programs have to use <code>/dev/fido/N</code> instead of
<code>/dev/uhidN</code> for U2F/FIDO.


<h3 id="r20191229">2019/12/29 - perl updated to 5.30.1</h3>

With the update to perl 5.30.1 some files should be removed manually.
Packages providing Perl XS modules will fail to work until they are
built with the new version.
New binary packages should be available (pkg_add -u will update them)
or they can be rebuilt from ports.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rm -rf /usr/libdata/perl5/*/Storable \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/*/arybase.pm \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/*/auto/arybase \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/B/Debug.pm \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/Locale/{Codes,Country,Currency,Language,Script}* \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/Math/BigInt/CalcEmu.pm \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/unicore/To/_PerlWB.pl \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/unicore/lib/GCB/EB.pl \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/unicore/lib/GCB/GAZ.pl \
       /usr/share/man/man3p/B::Debug.3p \
       /usr/share/man/man3p/Locale::{Codes*,Country,Currency,Language,Script}.3p \
       /usr/share/man/man3p/Math::BigInt::CalcEmu.3p \
       /usr/share/man/man3p/arybase.3p
</b><!--
--></pre>


<h3 id="r20200114">2020/01/14 - iked(8) automatic IPv6 blocking removed </h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> no longer automatically
blocks unencrypted outbound IPv6 packets.
This feature was intended to avoid accidental leakage, but in practice was
found to mostly be a cause of misconfiguration.
Instead, if you would like to explicitly block these packets, add the following
line to <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.conf.5">/etc/ipsec.conf</a></code>
(<b>not</b> iked.conf):

<pre class="cmdbox">
<b>flow esp out from ::/0 to ::/0 type deny</b>
</pre>

and enable loading it with

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl enable ipsec</b>           # to load at boot
# <b>ipsecctl -f /etc/ipsec.conf</b>  # to load immediately
</pre>

If you previously used <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>'s
<code>-6</code> flag to disable this feature, it is no longer needed and should
be removed from <code><a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.conf.local.8">/etc/rc.conf.local</a></code>
if used.<p>


<h3 id="r20200123">2020/01/23 - pppac(4) replaces tun(4) in npppd(8)</h3>

Support for using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tun.3">tun(4)</a>
as an access concentrator with
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/npppd.8">npppd(8)</a> has been removed.
This functionality has been moved into a dedicated
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pppac.4">pppac(4)</a> network interface
driver.
To migrate to the new driver, replace use of the tun interfaces in 
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/npppd.conf.5">npppd.conf(5)</a> with pppac.


<h3 id="r20200124">2020/01/24 - rebound(8) removed</h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rebound.8">rebound(8)</a> has been removed.
Users are advised to consider alternatives such as 
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.8">unwind(8)</a>.


<h3 id="r20200124b">2020/01/24 - [packages] firefox 71.0: pledge configuration change</h3>
Previously, disabling pledge was done by modifying an entry in about:config
but now it is done using files in <code>/etc/firefox</code> as explained in the pkg-readme
file, <code>/usr/local/share/doc/pkg-readmes/firefox</code>.
Unveil has been added to firefox to restrict filesystem access by default.
To grant access to additional paths or disable unveil, see the pkg-readme file.


<h3 id="r20200205">2020/02/05 - [packages] PostgreSQL major update</h3>

There was a major update to PostgreSQL 12.1.
Use <tt>pg_upgrade</tt> as described in the
<a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/ports/databases/postgresql/pkg/README-server?rev=1.27&content-type=text/plain">postgresql-server pkg-readme</a>
or do a dump/restore.


<h3 id="r20200208">2020/02/08 - dig(1), host(1) and nslookup(1) moved to /usr/bin</h3>

Old binaries should be deleted and scripts that use the full path to the tools
adapted.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rm -f /usr/sbin/{dig,host,nslookup}</b>
</pre>


<h3 id="r20200211">2020/02/11 - [packages] databases/redis updated to 5.0.7</h3>

Redis was updated to 5.0.7.
Users should have no problem migrating from 4.0 to 5.0.
A list of backward incompatible changes is at the end of the detailed
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES">release notes</a>.
Please note that the database is automatically upgraded on first run and
cannot be read by older versions - take a backup first if you are concerned
about compatibility.


<h3 id="r20200212">2020/02/12 - /etc/weekly locate.updatedb TMPDIR</h3>

<code>TMPDIR</code> is no longer propagated for <code>locate.updatedb</code> 
in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/weekly.8">weekly(8)</a>.
Custom <code>TMPDIR</code> values for <code>locate.updatedb</code> set in 
root crontab or <code>/etc/weekly.local</code> should be moved into
<code>/etc/locate.rc</code>.


<h3 id="20200213">2020/02/13 - man.conf(5) _whatdb directive no longer supported</h3>

In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.conf.5">man.conf(5)</a>,
change lines of the form

<pre class="cmdbox">
<b>_whatdb /usr/share/man/whatis.db</b>
</pre>

to this form:

<pre class="cmdbox">
<b>manpath /usr/share/man</b>
</pre>

The _whatdb directive has been obsolete since 2015.
