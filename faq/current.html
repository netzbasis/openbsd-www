Following -current and using snapshots

<hr>

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20191106">2019/11/06 - unwind(8): configuration syntax change</h3>
<em>asr</em> has been renamed to <em>stub</em> in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.conf.5">unwind.conf(5).</a>


<h3 id="r20191115">2019/11/15 - rpki-client(8) reuses the
<code>named</code> uid/gid</h3>

The new <code>_rpki-client</code> user recycles the user and group ids
of the "named" daemon user (<code>named</code>, uid/gid 70) which was
removed in 2014.  If you upgraded your system from all the way back
then and never deleted the user and group, delete them and the
<code>/var/named</code> directory:
   
<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>userdel named</b>
# <b>groupdel named</b>
# <b>rm -rf /var/named  # backup the data if still needed</b><!--
--></pre>

If you do not delete them before upgrading,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge">sysmerge(8)</a>
will fail and will need to be re-run manually after deleting them.


<h3 id="r20191127">2019/11/27 - unwind(8) no longer uses http to detect captive portals</h3>
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind">unwind(8)</a> uses a DNS based
heuristic to detect captive portals.
Existing <code>captive portal</code> sections must be removed from
<code>/etc/unwind.conf</code>.


<h3 id="r20191217b">2019/12/17 - usb(4) and uhid(4) changes</h3>

The default permissions of the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/usb.4">usb(4)</a> and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/uhid.4">uhid(4)</a> 
device nodes have been changed by restricting read-write access to the
root user.  Run <code>MAKEDEV</code> to update the device nodes manually:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cd /dev</b>
# <b>sh MAKEDEV all</b><!--
--></pre>

<p>
Access to FIDO/U2F security keys is now provided by the 
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fido.4">fido(4)</a> driver instead of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/uhid.4">uhid(4)</a>.
Programs have to use <code>/dev/fido/N</code> instead of
<code>/dev/uhidN</code> for U2F/FIDO.


<h3 id="r20191229">2019/12/29 - perl updated to 5.30.1</h3>

With the update to perl 5.30.1 some files should be removed manually.
Packages providing Perl XS modules will fail to work until they are
built with the new version.
New binary packages should be available (pkg_add -u will update them)
or they can be rebuilt from ports.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rm -rf /usr/libdata/perl5/*/Storable \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/*/arybase.pm \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/*/auto/arybase \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/B/Debug.pm \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/Locale/{Codes,Country,Currency,Language,Script}* \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/Math/BigInt/CalcEmu.pm \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/unicore/To/_PerlWB.pl \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/unicore/lib/GCB/EB.pl \
       /usr/libdata/perl5/unicore/lib/GCB/GAZ.pl \
       /usr/share/man/man3p/B::Debug.3p \
       /usr/share/man/man3p/Locale::{Codes*,Country,Currency,Language,Script}.3p \
       /usr/share/man/man3p/Math::BigInt::CalcEmu.3p \
       /usr/share/man/man3p/arybase.3p
</b><!--
--></pre>


<h3 id="r20200114">2020/1/14 - iked(8) automatic IPv6 blocking removed </h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> no longer automatically
blocks unencrypted outbound IPv6 packets.
This feature was intended to avoid accidental leakage, but in practice was
found to mostly be a cause of misconfiguration.
Instead, if you would like to explicitly block these packets, add the following
line to <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.conf.5">/etc/ipsec.conf</a></code>
(<b>not</b> iked.conf):

<pre class="cmdbox">
<b>flow esp out from ::/0 to ::/0 type deny</b>
</pre>

and enable loading it with

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl enable ipsec</b>           # to load at boot
# <b>ipsecctl -f /etc/ipsec.conf</b>  # to load immediately
</pre>

If you previously used <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>'s
<code>-6</code> flag to disable this feature, it is no longer needed and should
be removed from <code><a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.conf.local.8">/etc/rc.conf.local</a></code>
if used.<p>
