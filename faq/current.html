Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.
Active development sometimes pushes aggressive changes, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
In general, it's far better to use the
<!-- XXXrelease -->
<a href="upgrade62.html">OpenBSD upgrade procedure</a>
with a newer snapshot, as developers will have gone through much of the trouble
for you already.

<p>
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a>
before using -current and the instructions below.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
<i>-current</i>.
Upgrading by compiling your own source code is not supported.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20171019">2017/10/19 - [packages] neomutt binary renamed</h3>

In neomutt releases since 20171013, binaries and other files have been renamed 
so that they can coexist with mutt.
Users may wish to add a shell alias or a symlink for <tt>mutt -> neomutt</tt>.


<h3 id="r20171023">2017/10/23 - libpthread-stubs removed</h3>

With the integration of the pthread stub functions in libc,
libpthread-stubs is no longer needed in xenocara.
After upgrading base and packages, users may want to remove the old
installed library, either via the sysclean package or by running
the following commands:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/X11R6/lib</b>
# <b>rm libpthread-stubs.a \
     libpthread-stubs.so.2.0 \
     pkgconfig/pthread-stubs.pc</b>
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20171027">2017/10/27 - iked(8): ECP group incompatibility</h3>

In the final RFC 5903, the computation for the DH shared secret changed and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked">iked(8)</a>
was modified to follow the RFC.
This change is not backwards compatible, so if you are using ECP groups,
please make sure to upgrade all peers at the same time.


<h3 id="r20171029">2017/10/29 - vmd(8): switch configuration</h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd">vmd(8)</a> no longer automatically
creates an underlying bridge interface for virtual switches defined in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a>.
This will require users to create their bridges ahead of time, e.g.
using <tt>/etc/hostname.bridge0</tt>.
This also requires users to modify their
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a> files to add an
interface line to the switch definition, for example:

<blockquote><pre>
switch "uplink" {
    interface bridge0
}
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20171105">2017/11/05 - make room in <tt>/usr/share</tt> before upgrading</h3>

The relinking of libraries and kernels at boot time now happens in new directory
<tt>/usr/share/relink</tt>.
If you have little room left on the filesystem containing <tt>/usr/share</tt>,
you may want to run

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rm -r /usr/share/compile</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<b>before</b> rebooting into <tt>bsd.rd</tt>.


<h3 id="r20171108">2017/11/08 - isakmpd(8): ECP group incompatibility</h3>

In the final RFC 5903, the computation for the DH shared secret changed and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd">isakmpd(8)</a>
was modified to follow the RFC.
This change is not backwards compatible, so if you are using ECP groups,
please make sure to upgrade all peers at the same time.
