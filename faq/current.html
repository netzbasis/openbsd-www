<p>

Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.
Active development sometimes pushes aggressive changes, and complications can
arise when building the latest code from a previous point in time.
Some of the shortcuts for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
In general, it's far better to use the
<!-- XXXrelease -->
<a href="upgrade60.html">OpenBSD upgrade procedure</a>
with a newer snapshot, as developers will have gone through the trouble for
you already.

<p>
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a>
before using -current and the instructions below.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
<i>-current</i>.
Upgrading by compiling your own source code is not supported.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20160801">2016/08/01 - new mandoc.db(5) format</h3>

To update all <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.db.5">mandoc.db(5)</a>
files to the new format, run:

<blockquote><pre>
makewhatis
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20160808">2016/08/08 - mandatory W^X enforcement</h3>

W^X violations are now only permitted for binaries marked <b>wxneeded</b>
executed from filesystems marked <b>wxallowed</b>.
<ul>
<li>The base system is clean.
<li>Starting in 6.0, the installer sets the <tt>/usr/local</tt>
    filesystem to <b>wxallowed</b> -- if your filesystem is not
    set so, make this change.
<li>The ports tree contains a number of binaries which are not
    yet marked <b>wxneeded</b> but work is underway to mark them all.
</ul>


<h3 id="r20160810">2016/08/10 - RELRO by default on all archs but luna88k</h3>

The system now uses the RELRO design ("read-only after relocation") to
lay out executables and libraries such that they use fewer mappings and
more of the initial data can be protected as read-only.
Unlike other OSes, this applies to <b>all</b> dynamic executables and libraries
by default, as well as to static PIE executables.
<p>
To upgrade over this, start from a system running 6.0-release or later and an
up-to-date source tree:
<blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/src &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make includes
cd /usr/src/libexec/ld.so
make SUBDIR= depend &amp;&amp; make SUBDIR= &amp;&amp; doas make SUBDIR= install
cd /usr/src/lib/csu
make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; doas make install
cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils-2.17
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper &amp;&amp; doas make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install
cd /usr/src &amp;&amp; make build
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20160812">2016/08/12 - [ports] py-elasticsearch-curator update</h3>

With the update of Elasticsearch Curator to the 4.x version, the CLI interface
changed.
Instead of parameters, yaml configuration files are used to steer actions of
curator.
Configuration file documentation can be found on the
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/4.0/index.html">
curator reference pages</a>.


<h3 id="r20160814">2016/08/14 - qabs(3) and qdiv(3) manpages removed</h3>

Their content was merged into the labs(3) and lldiv(3) manpages,
so the separate files should be removed and and the database updated.

<blockquote><pre>
rm -f /usr/share/man/man3/qabs.3 /usr/share/man/man3/qdiv.3
makewhatis
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20160901">2016/09/01 - armv7 complete ABI break</h3>

OpenBSD/armv7 moved to the ARM EABI.  This is a hard ABI break which
you cannot cross with a simple build.  To upgrade through this break,
you need to upgrade from a snapshot.


<h3 id="r20160901a">2016/09/01 - [ports] letskencrypt renamed/moved to base</h3>

<tt>letskencrypt</tt>, previously in <tt>ports/security</tt>, has been imported
to base under its new name <tt>acme-client</tt>.
Adjust scripts/cronjobs as necessary.


<h3 id="r20160903">2016/09/03 - armv7 is now PIE</h3>

The armv7 platform has been switched to PIE (position-independent executables)
by default.
Everyone is encouraged to update via snapshots (dated after 2016/09/02); if you
want to upgrade via sources, follow these instructions:

<p>
First, install the new system Makefiles with the change to PIE_ARCH in
<tt>bsd.own.mk</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/src/share/mk &amp;&amp; make install
</pre></blockquote>

Then, recompile and install gcc and binutils.

<blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils-2.17
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean &amp;&amp; make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper obj &amp;&amp; \
       make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend &amp;&amp; make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/cc
make clean &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils-2.17 &amp;&amp; make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install
</pre></blockquote>

Finally, recompile your system by following the procedure outlined in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/release.8">release(8)</a>.


<h3 id="r20160908">2016/09/08 - armv7 now supports static PIE</h3>

The armv7 platform now also supports PIE for static binaries.
Everyone is encouraged to update via snapshots (dated after 2016/09/09);
if you want to upgrade via sources, follow these instructions:

<p>
First, install the new system Makefiles with the change to
<tt>STATICPIE_ARCH</tt> in <tt>bsd.own.mk</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/src/share/mk &amp;&amp; make install
</pre></blockquote>

Then, build and install <tt>rcrt0.o</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/src/lib/csu
make clean &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre></blockquote>

Then, recompile and install gcc:

<blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/cc
make clean &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre></blockquote>

Finally, recompile your system by following the procedure outlined in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/release.8">release(8)</a>.


<h3 id="r20160909">2016/09/09 - /dev/sound removed</h3>

Remove unused device nodes:

<blockquote><pre>
rm -f /dev/sound*
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20160913">2016/09/13 - [ports] Railo replaced with Lucee</h3>

Railo has been replaced with Lucee (a fork).
Make notes on your existing Railo configuration before updating.
You will need to adjust Tomcat configuration, and configure Lucee according
to your previous Railo configuration.


<h3 id="r20160919">2016/09/19 - softraid crypto switched to bcrypt PBKDF</h3>

New volumes will be created with bcrypt PBKDF, however existing volumes
will continue to use PKCS5 PBKDF2 until a passphrase change is made.

<p>
If you're booting from softraid crypto, ensure that your boot loader has been
upgraded to a version that supports bcrypt prior to changing your passphrase.
That is to say, it should be from a snapshot dated after 2016/09/19.
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/boot.8">boot(8)</a> version should be at
least 3.33 on amd64 and 3.31 on i386.
Also be aware that once the passphrase has been changed, an older version of
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/bioctl.8">bioctl(8)</a> (one that does not
support bcrypt PBKDF) will not be able to "unlock" the volume.


<h3 id="r20160923">2016/09/23 - sqlite3 moved back to ports</h3>

SQLite has moved from base back to ports.
The old files must be removed before building from ports:

<blockquote><pre>
rm /usr/bin/sqlite3
rm /usr/include/sqlite3*.h
rm /usr/lib/pkgconfig/sqlite3.pc
rm /usr/libdata/perl5/site_perl/*-openbsd/sqlite3*.ph
rm /usr/share/man/man1/sqlite3.1
rm /usr/lib/libsqlite3*         <b># see below</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Ports bulk builders must remove the old libraries before building
new packages.

<!-- XXX For 6.1 upgrade notes: 1. update OS, 2. update all packages, 3. rm files. -->
<p>
Users should wait until updated packages are available
before removing the libraries, otherwise many installed packages
will break.
You can check:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>pkg_info -S nss</b>
Information for inst:nss-3.26

Signature:
nss-3.26,@nspr-4.12p0,c.89.1,nspr4.23.3,plc4.23.3,plds4.23.3,pthread.23.0,<b>sqlite3.</b><b style="color:#e00000">33.0</b>,z.5.0
</pre></blockquote>

If the sqlite3 version number is 32.0 or lower, they are not updated yet.


<h3 id="r20160927">2016/09/27 - more secure package and firmware signatures</h3>

Packages and firmware are now signed with a more secure scheme.
If <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a> and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.1">fw_update(1)</a> complain
about unsigned packages/firmware, you must upgrade to a more recent snapshot
or rebuild the system&mdash;involves pieces in libc,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/signify.1">signify(1)</a> and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a>,
so following <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/release.8">release(8)</a>
is the best way.


<h3 id="r20161005">2016/10/06 - new build infrastructure,
<tt>noperm</tt> release process</h3>

The infrastructure to build the base system from source and to make a release
has changed.
The <tt>SUDO</tt> variable was removed from the base system makefiles and the
<tt>make build</tt> command now <b>must</b> be issued by root.
Whenever possible, the makefiles will de-escalate privileges to
<tt>BUILDUSER</tt> (as specified in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mk.conf.5">mk.conf(5)</a>; defaults to
<tt>USER</tt>).
Make sure that <tt>/usr/obj</tt> or <tt>/usr/xobj</tt> is empty and owned by
<tt>BUILDUSER</tt> before starting a build. 

<p>
Start the build as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install</b>	# only needed the first time
# <b>cd /usr/src && make obj && make build</b>
</pre></blockquote>

To make a <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/release.8">release(8)</a>, further
setup is required:

<ul>
  <li>Mount a <b>noperm filesystem</b> on <tt>/dest</tt>, of size at least
    <tt>1G</tt>, of type <tt>ffs</tt>, and with the <tt>noperm</tt>
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount.8#noperm">mount(8)</a> option set.
  <li>The root directory of the filesystem must be owned by <tt>BUILDUSER</tt>, with
    permissions <tt>700</tt>.
  <li>Create directories <tt>/dest/base</tt> and <tt>/dest/xbase</tt>.
  <li>The <tt>RELEASEDIR</tt> must be owned by <tt>BUILDUSER</tt>.
</ul>

To build a base release, set <tt>DESTDIR=/dest/base</tt> and to build a xenocara
release, set <tt>DESTDIR=/dest/xbase</tt>.


<h3 id="r20161014">2016/10/14 - [ports] Ansible copy module change</h3>

The <tt>copy</tt> module of Ansible added a newline to the value of
the <tt>content</tt> attribute in case it was not present. This
behaviour is non-standard and was not documented. It has been reverted
in the <em>ansible-2.1.2.0p0</em> package.
<br>
If you previously relied on this behaviour you will need to explicitly
add <tt>\n</tt> to your playbooks.


<h3 id="r20161014a">2016/10/14 - kernel builds now need <tt>make obj</tt></h3>

Kernels now build in an <tt>obj</tt> directory just like the rest of the source
tree.
This helps ensuring that the <tt>src</tt> tree can be read-only during builds.
Some cleanup needs to be done before updating your source trees via cvs:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /sys</b>
$ <b>rm -r arch/*/compile/[GR]*</b>
$ <b>rm arch/*/compile/.cvsignore</b>
$ <b>cvs -q up -Pd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The new way of configuring, building and installing a kernel is:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /sys/arch/$(machine)/compile/GENERIC.MP</b>
$ <b>doas make obj</b>
$ <b>make config</b>
$ <b>make</b>
$ <b>doas make install</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="r20161024">2016/10/24 - uxterm and koi8xterm removed</h3>

The <tt>uxterm</tt> and <tt>koi8rxterm</tt> shell scripts have been removed, as
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/xterm.1">xterm(1)</a> on OpenBSD is already set
up to support UTF-8.
Some cleanup needs to be done after upgrading to -current:

<blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/X11R6
rm bin/koi8rxterm bin/uxterm
rm share/X11/app-defaults/KOI8RXTerm share/X11/app-defaults/UXTerm
rm man/man1/koi8rxterm.1 man/man1/uxterm.1
</pre></blockquote>

If you edited any configuration files to call <tt>uxterm</tt>,
do not forget to change these to call <tt>xterm</tt> directly.
If you defined X resources for UXTerm, consider moving them to XTerm.

<h3 id="r20161104">2016/11/04 - [ports] sympa update</h3>

The <tt>mail/sympa</tt> mailing list server port was updated to a new version.
The <a href="https://www.sympa.org/faq/upgrade-to-v6.2">upgrade notes</a>
explain how to migrate your setup.

<h3 id="r20161104a">2016/11/04 - [ports] nginx dynamic modules</h3>

The <tt>www/nginx</tt> port has been converted to use subpackages with dynamic
modules, instead of using FLAVORs.
If you previously were using a FLAVORed version of nginx, or the mail or stream
modules, you need to install the apropriate subpackage(s).
You also need to modify your nginx configuration to use <tt>load_module</tt> for
each dynamic module you want to load.

<h3 id="r20161109a">2016/11/09 - perl headers removed</h3>

The perl headers are no longer generated and should be removed:

<blockquote><pre>
rm -rf /usr/libdata/perl5/site_perl
</pre></blockquote>
