Following -current and using snapshots

<hr>

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20200529">2020/05/29 - [ports] net/isc-bind example files dropped</h3>

Outdated example configuration (including some "standard" zone files and
an old root hints file) have been removed from the BIND 9 port.
Root hints can be removed from your configuration, in which case the (newer)
compiled-in defaults will be used.
If your existing configuration uses these files, back them up before updating:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cd /var/named</b>
# <b>tar czf old-bind-files.tgz etc/bind.keys etc/root.hint standard</b>
</pre>


<h3 id="r20200624">2020/06/24 - TLS defaults changed in ldapd(8)</h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ldapd">ldapd(8)</a> no longer defaults to using
the insecure TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 protocols and ciphers with <code>tls</code> and
<code>ldaps</code>.
If your environment requires this for compatibility with older clients, add the
new <code>legacy</code> keyword before <code>tls</code> and <code>ldaps</code>
in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ldapd.conf">ldapd.conf(5)</a>.


<h3 id="r20200627">2020/06/27 - libperl.a no longer installed</h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/perl">perl(1)</a> no longer installs libperl.a.
You should remove the old file.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rm /usr/lib/libperl.a</b>
</pre>


<h3 id="r20200630">2020/06/30 - snmpd.conf(5) socket no longer supported</h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.conf">snmpd.conf(5)</a> no longer
supports the <code>socket</code> keyword. The socket lines should be removed
before upgrading.


<h3 id="r20200710">2020/07/10 - libxkbui removed from Xenocara</h3>

Xenocara no longer includes libxkbui, which has been deprecated by X.Org.
It should be manually removed.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rm /usr/X11R6/lib/libxkbui.*</b>
# <b>rm /usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig/xkbui.pc</b>
# <b>rm /usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions/XKBui.h</b>
</pre>


<h3 id="r20200807">2020/08/07 - [ports] www/goaccess default config file path</h3>

The update to 1.4 moves the default config file path from
<code>/etc/goaccess.conf</code> to <code>/etc/goaccess/goaccess.conf</code>,
make sure to move your own config file if you customized one.


<h3 id="r20200824">2020/08/24 - httpd.conf(5) fastcgi grammar change</h3>

To support non-localhost fastcgi sockets, the grammar in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.conf">httpd.conf(5)</a> has been changed
from <code>fastcgi socket :port</code> to
<code>fastcgi socket tcp hostname/ip port</code>.
For example,

<pre class="cmdbox">
location "/www/*" {
	fastcgi socket :9090
}
</pre>

must be changed to

<pre class="cmdbox">
location "/www/*" {
	fastcgi socket tcp 127.0.0.1 9090
}
</pre>


<h3 id="r20200910">2020/09/10 - snmpd.conf(5) listen on grammar change</h3>

Snmpd's listen on statement changed from
<pre class="cmdbox">
listen on &lt;address&gt; [tcp | udp]
</pre>

to

<pre class="cmdbox">
listen on [tcp | udp] &lt;address&gt; [port &lt;port&gt;]
</pre>

The old syntax is deprecated and will be removed in the next release.
