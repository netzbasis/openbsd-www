Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.
Active development sometimes pushes aggressive changes, and complications can
arise when building the latest code from a previous point in time.
Some of the shortcuts for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
In general, it's far better to use the
<!-- XXXrelease -->
<a href="upgrade59.html">OpenBSD upgrade procedure</a>
with a newer snapshot, as developers will have gone through the trouble for
you already.

<p>
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a>
before using -current and the instructions below.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
<i>-current</i>.
Upgrading by compiling your own source code is not supported.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20160307">2016/03/07 - lpd(8) default spool directory change</h3>
The
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/lpd">lpd(8)</a>
top spool directory <tt>/var/spool/output</tt> is now only writable by root.
<br>
Point the <tt>sd</tt> path in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/printcap">printcap(5)</a>
to a subdirectory where the <tt>daemon</tt> group has write access.
It defaults to <tt>/var/spool/output/lpd</tt>.

<h3 id="r20160319">2016/03/19 - csu and ld.so update</h3>
The definitions of <tt>environ</tt> and <tt>__progname</tt> for dynamicly
linked programs have been moved from the C startup code to
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ld.so">ld.so(1)</a>.
An updated <tt>ld.so</tt> must be built and installed before running
make build.
<blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/src/libexec/ld.so
make SUBDIR= obj
make SUBDIR= depend
make SUBDIR=
make SUBDIR= install
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="r20160331">2016/03/31 - changes in wscons and synaptics</h3>
The previous version of the synaptics driver won't work with a new
version of the kernel. Touchpad users must rebuild that driver.

<h3 id="r20160401">2016/04/01 - rcctl(8) syntax change</h3>
The keyword for listing enabled but stopped daemons with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rcctl">rcctl(8)</a>
has changed from <tt>faulty</tt> to <tt>failed</tt>.
<blockquote><pre>
rcctl ls failed
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="r20160424">2014/04/24 - option WSDISPLAY_COMPAT_PCVT removed</h3>
The kernel option WSDISPLAY_COMPAT_PCVT and associated code have been removed.
You need to have a recent enough (built after april, 3)  X server before
rebooing a new kernel.
