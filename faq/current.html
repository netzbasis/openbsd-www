Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.
Active development sometimes pushes aggressive changes, and complications can
arise when building the latest code from a previous point in time.
Some of the shortcuts for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
In general, it's far better to use the
<!-- XXXrelease -->
<a href="upgrade61.html">OpenBSD upgrade procedure</a>
with a newer snapshot, as developers will have gone through the trouble for
you already.

<p>
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a>
before using -current and the instructions below.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
<i>-current</i>.
Upgrading by compiling your own source code is not supported.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20170417">2017/04/17 - build infrastructure change</h3>

The build infrastructure has been changed to allow building <tt>clang</tt>
alongside <tt>gcc</tt>.
This requires an update of the make "include" files:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install</b>
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20170419">2017/04/19 - clang enabled for amd64 and i386</h3>

The <tt>clang</tt> compiler is now built alongside <tt>gcc</tt> on the amd64 and
i386 architectures.
It is recommended that you upgrade using a snapshot.

<p>
If you build your own releases, note that <tt>make release</tt> now needs more
than <tt>2G</tt> space on <tt>/usr/obj</tt>.
Increasing the size to <tt>3G</tt> is recommended.

<p>
If you wish to upgrade from source, update the build infrastructure:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Bootstrap <tt>clang</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>pkg_add g++</b>
# <b>cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/clang</b>
# <b>make obj</b>
# <b>make BOOTSTRAP_CLANG=yes</b>
# <b>make install</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Compile <tt>libcompiler_rt</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src/lib/libcompiler_rt</b>
# <b>make obj</b>
# <b>make depend</b>
# <b>make</b>
# <b>make install</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Then do a regular <tt>make build</tt> and <tt>make release</tt>.
