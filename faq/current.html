Following -current and using snapshots

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of downloading (and verifying) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, booting from it,
and choosing <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is not supported.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20181016">2018/10/16 - [packages] net/dnscrypt-proxy switch to different configuration</h3>

dnscrypt-proxy received a major update.
One of the changes is the configuration.
Users are advised to check that <code>/etc/dnscrypt-proxy.toml</code>
fits their needs.


<h3 id="r20181024">2018/10/24 - libcrypto ASN.1 header removed (<code>openssl/asn1_mac.h</code>)</h3>

The <code>openssl/asn1_mac.h</code> header has been removed from libcrypto
and will no longer be installed.
This should be manually removed from an existing installation:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rm /usr/include/openssl/asn1_mac.h</b>
</pre>


<h3 id="r20181026">2018/10/26 - setuid bit removed from <code>/usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg</code></h3>

The <code>Xorg</code> binary is no longer installed setuid.
So <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/startx">startx(1)</a> can no longer be used by non-root users.
The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xenodm">xenodm(1)</a> display manager has to be used.

To set it up:
<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl enable xenodm</b>
# <b>rcctl start xenodm</b>
</pre>


<h3 id="r20181106">2018/11/06 - <code>/etc/malloc.conf</code> replaced by sysctl</h3>

The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc">malloc(3)</a> family of functions
do no longer read options from the <code>malloc.conf</code> symbolic link.
Instead, the new sysctl <code>vm.malloc_conf</code> is used.
This makes processes no longer dependent on the file system for their malloc
options.

Set it like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# sysctl vm.malloc_conf="S"
</pre>


<h3 id="r20181114">2018/11/14 - ifconfig(8): <code>vlandev</code> and <code>vlan</code> upcoming option removal</h3>

The <code>vlandev</code> and <code>vlan</code> configuration options have been
deprecated since <a href="https://openbsd.org/faq/upgrade62.html">6.2</a>
and will be removed.
Use <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8#parent">parent</a></code>
and <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8#vnetid">vnetid</a></code>
instead.


<h3 id="r20181116">2018/11/14 - vlan(4): Replace <code>link0</code> flag with <code>txprio</code></h3>

Forcing the priority field in the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vlan.4">vlan(4)</a> and svlan(4)
protocol headers is now configured with the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>
<code>txprio</code> configuration option.
This replaces the use of the <code>link0</code> flag which used the
<code>llprio</code> in the packet priority field instead.
