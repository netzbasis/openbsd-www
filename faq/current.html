<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.



<h3 id="r20201107">2020/11/07 - iked.conf "to dynamic"</h3>

New keywords have been introduced to
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.conf">iked.conf(5)</a>
to simplify the configuration when using "config address".
Previously, when either "<code>to 0.0.0.0</code>" or "<code>to 0.0.0.0/0</code>" 
were used, they would be replaced with the peer's assigned address when
creating flows.
"<code>to dynamic</code>" has been introduced to make the configuration
syntax clearer.
<p>
"<code>to 0.0.0.0</code>" works as before but can be updated to the new
syntax if wanted.
<p>
"<code>to 0.0.0.0/0</code>" will now be treated literally;
if you want the old behaviour you must change to "<code>to dynamic</code>".


<h3 id="r20201216">2020/12/16 - pf port range validation</h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf(4)">pf(4)</a> and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl(8)">pfctl(8)</a> are now stricter
about validating rules which use port ranges.
<p>
The following show incorrect rules that were previously accepted:
"<code>port 2004:2000</code>", "<code>port 2004 &gt;&lt; 2000</code>",
"<code>port 2004 &lt;&gt; 2000</code>" (range should be low-high),
and "<code>port 2000 &gt;&lt; 2000</code>" (range should not be a single
port).
<p>
If you use ranges and don't have console access, check them <b>before</b>
upgrading.
