Following -current and using snapshots

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20191106">2019/11/06 - unwind(8): configuration syntax change</h3>
<em>asr</em> has been renamed to <em>stub</em> in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.conf.5">unwind.conf(5).</a>


<h3 id="r20191115">2019/11/15 - rpki-client(8) reuses the
<code>named</code> uid/gid</h3>

The new <code>_rpki-client</code> user recycles the user and group ids
of the "named" daemon user (<code>named</code>, uid/gid 70) which was
removed in 2014.  If you upgraded your system from all the way back
then and never deleted the user and group, delete them and the
<code>/var/named</code> directory:
   
<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>userdel named</b>
# <b>groupdel named</b>
# <b>rm -rf /var/named  # backup the data if still needed</b><!--
--></pre>

If you do not delete them before upgrading,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge">sysmerge(8)</a>
will fail and will need to be re-run manually after deleting them.
