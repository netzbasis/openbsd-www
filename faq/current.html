Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.
Active development sometimes pushes aggressive changes, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
In general, it's far better to use the
<!-- XXXrelease -->
<a href="upgrade62.html">OpenBSD upgrade procedure</a>
with a newer snapshot, as developers will have gone through much of the trouble
for you already.

<p>
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a>
before using -current and the instructions below.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
<i>-current</i>.
Upgrading by compiling your own source code is not supported.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20171019">2017/10/19 - [packages] neomutt binary renamed</h3>

In neomutt releases since 20171013, binaries and other files have been renamed 
so that they can coexist with mutt.
Users may wish to add a shell alias or a symlink for <tt>mutt -> neomutt</tt>.


<h3 id="r20171023">2017/10/23 - libpthread-stubs removed</h3>

With the integration of the pthread stub functions in libc,
libpthread-stubs is no longer needed in xenocara.
After upgrading base and packages, users may want to remove the old
installed library, either via the sysclean package or by running
the following commands:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/X11R6/lib</b>
# <b>rm libpthread-stubs.a \
     libpthread-stubs.so.2.0 \
     pkgconfig/pthread-stubs.pc</b>
</pre></blockquote>
