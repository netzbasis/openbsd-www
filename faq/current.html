Following -current and using snapshots

<hr>

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
<!-- XXXrelease replace this paragraph with the commented-out one -->
This process typically consists of downloading (and verifying) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, booting from it,
and choosing <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
<!--
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-c</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
-->
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20190529">2019/05/29 - vmctl(8): command line syntax changed</h3>

The order of the arguments in the <code>create</code>,
<code>start</code>, and <code>stop</code> commands of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmctl.8">vmctl(8)</a> has been changed to
match a commonly expected style.
Manual usage or scripting with vmctl must be adjusted to use the new
syntax.
For example, the old syntax looked like this:
<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>vmctl create disk.qcow2 -s 50G</b>
</pre>

The new syntax specifies the command options before the argument:
<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>vmctl create -s 50G disk.qcow2</b>
</pre>


<h3 id="r20190607">2019/06/07 - acme-client(1): api url changed</h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a> has
been updated to implement the recently published RFC 8555.
Users must change the api url in <code>/etc/acme-client.conf</code> from
<pre class="cmdbox">
https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
</pre>
to
<pre class="cmdbox">
https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
</pre>


<h3 id="r20190607a">2019/06/07 - [ports] MariaDB upgrade</h3>

MariaDB was upgraded to the 10.3 branch.
Due to changes in redo logs, <b>ensure that your previous version was
shut down cleanly before upgrading</b>.
The <code>/etc/my.cnf</code> option <code>innodb_additional_mem_pool_size</code>,
found in some old default configurations, is no longer supported - remove it if present.
If the new version fails to start, review <code>/var/mysql/(hostname).err</code>.
As usual, run mysql_upgrade(1) after the update.


<h3 id="r20190611">2019/06/11 - acme-client(1): command line flags retired</h3>

The -A and -D flags have been removed from
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a>.
The private keys are now created automatically if missing.
If you were using either of these flags on your regular command lines,
remove them.


<h3 id="r20190617">2019/06/18 - doas(1): altered environment variables</h3>

The environment variable handling in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/doas.1">doas(1)</a>
has been changed.
In particular HOME and PATH are now reset to the target user.


<h3 id="r20190619">2019/06/19 - [ports] courier-imap utf-8 support</h3>

In courier-imap full utf-8 support has been enabled,
if you are using imap folders with utf8 names you should check and/or
convert them using maildirmake(1) <code>--checkutf8</code> and <code>--convutf8</code> options.


<h3 id="r20190625">2019/06/25 - bgpctl(8) removal of irrfilter</h3>

The bgpctl(8) irrfilter command has been removed. People interested in
generating prefix- and as-sets from IRR data should use bgpq3 from ports.


<h3 id="r20190626">2019/06/26 - [ports] gzdoom incompatibles with old saves</h3>

gzdoom was updated to 4.1.2 which makes it incompatible with previously saved games.
There is no upstream solution.
