Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.
Active development sometimes pushes aggressive changes, and complications can
arise when building the latest code from a previous point in time.
Some of the shortcuts for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
In general, it's far better to use the
<!-- XXXrelease -->
<a href="upgrade60.html">OpenBSD upgrade procedure</a>
with a newer snapshot, as developers will have gone through the trouble for
you already.

<p>
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a>
before using -current and the instructions below.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
<i>-current</i>.
Upgrading by compiling your own source code is not supported.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.

<h3 id="r20160801">2016/08/01 - new mandoc.db(5) format</h3>
To update all <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.db.5">mandoc.db(5)</a>
files to the new format, run:

<blockquote><pre>
makewhatis
</pre></blockquote>
<p>

<h3 id="r20160808">2016/08/08 - Mandatory W^X enforcement</h3>

W^X violations are now only permitted for binaries marked <b>wxneeded</b>
executed from filesystems marked <b>wxallowed</b>.
<ul>
<li>The base system is clean.
<li>Starting in 6.0, the installer sets the </b>/usr/local</b>
    filesystem to <b>wxallowed</b> -- if your filesystem is not
    set so, make this change.
<li>The ports tree contains a number of binaries which are not
    yet marked <b>wxneeded</b> but work is underway to mark them all.
</ul>
<p>

<h3 id="r20160809">2016/08/09 - RELRO by default on all archs but mips64 and m88k</h3>

The linker now lays out executables and libraries to use fewer mappings,
marking the data that can read-only after relocation with a special
section instead of "__got_start" and "__got_end" symbols.
This applies to <b>all</b> dynamic executables and libraries,
as well as static PIE executables.
