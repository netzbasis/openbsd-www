<hr>
<p>

Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.
Active development sometimes pushes aggressive changes, and complications can
arise when building the latest code from a previous point in time.
Some of the shortcuts for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
In general, it's far better to use the
<!-- XXXrelease -->
<a href="upgrade60.html">OpenBSD upgrade procedure</a>
with a newer snapshot, as developers will have gone through the trouble for
you already.

<p>
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a>
before using -current and the instructions below.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
<i>-current</i>.
<!-- XXXrelease: put the following sentence back and remove its replacement -->
<!--Upgrading by compiling your own source code is not supported.-->
<p>
In particular, upgrading by compiling from source from OpenBSD 6.0
<i>-release</i> to <i>-current</i> is <b>not supported</b>.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20160801">2016/08/01 - new mandoc.db(5) format</h3>

To update all <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.db.5">mandoc.db(5)</a>
files to the new format, run:

<blockquote><pre>
makewhatis
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20160808">2016/08/08 - mandatory W^X enforcement</h3>

W^X violations are now only permitted for binaries marked <b>wxneeded</b>
executed from filesystems marked <b>wxallowed</b>.
<ul>
<li>The base system is clean.
<li>Starting in 6.0, the installer sets the <tt>/usr/local</tt>
    filesystem to <b>wxallowed</b> -- if your filesystem is not
    set so, make this change.
<li>The ports tree contains a number of binaries which are not
    yet marked <b>wxneeded</b> but work is underway to mark them all.
</ul>


<h3 id="r20160812">2016/08/12 - [ports] py-elasticsearch-curator update</h3>

With the update of Elasticsearch Curator to the 4.x version, the CLI interface
changed.
Instead of parameters, yaml configuration files are used to steer actions of
curator.
Configuration file documentation can be found on the
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/4.0/index.html">
curator reference pages</a>.


<h3 id="r20160814">2016/08/14 - qabs(3) and qdiv(3) manpages removed</h3>

Their content was merged into the labs(3) and lldiv(3) manpages,
so the separate files should be removed and and the database updated.

<blockquote><pre>
rm -f /usr/share/man/man3/qabs.3 /usr/share/man/man3/qdiv.3
makewhatis
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20160901a">2016/09/01 - [ports] letskencrypt renamed/moved to base</h3>

<tt>letskencrypt</tt>, previously in <tt>ports/security</tt>, has been imported
to base under its new name <tt>acme-client</tt>.
Adjust scripts/cronjobs as necessary.


<h3 id="r20160909">2016/09/09 - /dev/sound removed</h3>

Remove unused device nodes:

<blockquote><pre>
rm -f /dev/sound*
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20160913">2016/09/13 - [ports] Railo replaced with Lucee</h3>

Railo has been replaced with Lucee (a fork).
Make notes on your existing Railo configuration before updating.
You will need to adjust Tomcat configuration, and configure Lucee according
to your previous Railo configuration.


<h3 id="r20160919">2016/09/19 - softraid crypto switched to bcrypt PBKDF</h3>

New volumes will be created with bcrypt PBKDF, however existing volumes
will continue to use PKCS5 PBKDF2 until a passphrase change is made.

<p>
If you're booting from softraid crypto, ensure that your boot loader has been
upgraded to a version that supports bcrypt prior to changing your passphrase.
That is to say, it should be from a snapshot dated after 2016/09/19.
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/boot.8">boot(8)</a> version should be at
least 3.33 on amd64 and 3.31 on i386.
Also be aware that once the passphrase has been changed, an older version of
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/bioctl.8">bioctl(8)</a> (one that does not
support bcrypt PBKDF) will not be able to "unlock" the volume.


<h3 id="r20160923">2016/09/23 - sqlite3 moved back to ports</h3>

SQLite has moved from base back to ports.
Remove the following files <b>after</b> upgrading the OS and updating the
packages, but <b>before</b> building any ports:

<blockquote><pre>
rm /usr/bin/sqlite3
rm /usr/include/sqlite3*.h
rm /usr/lib/pkgconfig/sqlite3.pc
rm /usr/libdata/perl5/site_perl/*-openbsd/sqlite3*.ph
rm /usr/share/man/man1/sqlite3.1
rm /usr/lib/libsqlite3*
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20160927">2016/09/27 - more secure package and firmware signatures</h3>

Packages and firmware are now signed with a more secure scheme.
If <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a> and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.1">fw_update(1)</a> complain
about unsigned packages/firmware, you must upgrade to a more recent snapshot
or rebuild the system&mdash;involves pieces in libc,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/signify.1">signify(1)</a> and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a>,
so following <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/release.8">release(8)</a>
is the best way.


<h3 id="r20161005">2016/10/06 - new build infrastructure,
<tt>noperm</tt> release process</h3>

The infrastructure to build the base system from source and to make a release
has changed.
The <tt>SUDO</tt> variable was removed from the base system makefiles and the
<tt>make build</tt> command now <b>must</b> be issued by root.
Whenever possible, the makefiles will de-escalate privileges to
<tt>BUILDUSER</tt> (as specified in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mk.conf.5">mk.conf(5)</a>; defaults to
<tt>USER</tt>).
Make sure that <tt>/usr/obj</tt> or <tt>/usr/xobj</tt> is empty and owned by
<tt>BUILDUSER</tt> before starting a build. 

<p>
Start the build as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install</b>	# only needed the first time
# <b>cd /usr/src && make obj && make build</b>
</pre></blockquote>

To make a <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/release.8">release(8)</a>, further
setup is required:

<ul>
  <li>Mount a <b>noperm filesystem</b> on <tt>/dest</tt>, of size at least
    <tt>1G</tt>, of type <tt>ffs</tt>, and with the <tt>noperm</tt>
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount.8#noperm">mount(8)</a> option set.
  <li>The root directory of the filesystem must be owned by <tt>BUILDUSER</tt>, with
    permissions <tt>700</tt>.
  <li>Create directories <tt>/dest/base</tt> and <tt>/dest/xbase</tt>.
  <li>The <tt>RELEASEDIR</tt> must be owned by <tt>BUILDUSER</tt>.
</ul>

To build a base release, set <tt>DESTDIR=/dest/base</tt> and to build a xenocara
release, set <tt>DESTDIR=/dest/xbase</tt>.


<h3 id="r20161014">2016/10/14 - [ports] Ansible copy module change</h3>

The <tt>copy</tt> module of Ansible added a newline to the value of
the <tt>content</tt> attribute in case it was not present. This
behaviour is non-standard and was not documented. It has been reverted
in the <em>ansible-2.1.2.0p0</em> package.
<br>
If you previously relied on this behaviour you will need to explicitly
add <tt>\n</tt> to your playbooks.


<h3 id="r20161014a">2016/10/14 - kernel builds now need <tt>make obj</tt></h3>

Kernels now build in an <tt>obj</tt> directory just like the rest of the source
tree.
This helps ensuring that the <tt>src</tt> tree can be read-only during builds.
Some cleanup needs to be done before updating your source trees via cvs:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /sys</b>
$ <b>rm -r arch/*/compile/[GR]*</b>
$ <b>rm arch/*/compile/.cvsignore</b>
$ <b>cvs -q up -Pd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The new way of configuring, building and installing a kernel is:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /sys/arch/$(machine)/compile/GENERIC.MP</b>
$ <b>doas make obj</b>
$ <b>make config</b>
$ <b>make</b>
$ <b>doas make install</b>
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20161024">2016/10/24 - uxterm and koi8xterm removed</h3>

The <tt>uxterm</tt> and <tt>koi8rxterm</tt> shell scripts have been removed, as
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/xterm.1">xterm(1)</a> on OpenBSD is already set
up to support UTF-8.
Some cleanup needs to be done after upgrading to -current:

<blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/X11R6
rm bin/koi8rxterm bin/uxterm
rm share/X11/app-defaults/KOI8RXTerm share/X11/app-defaults/UXTerm
rm man/man1/koi8rxterm.1 man/man1/uxterm.1
</pre></blockquote>

If you edited any configuration files to call <tt>uxterm</tt>,
do not forget to change these to call <tt>xterm</tt> directly.
If you defined X resources for UXTerm, consider moving them to XTerm.


<h3 id="r20161104">2016/11/04 - [ports] sympa update</h3>

The <tt>mail/sympa</tt> mailing list server port was updated to a new version.
The <a href="https://www.sympa.org/faq/upgrade-to-v6.2">upgrade notes</a>
explain how to migrate your setup.


<h3 id="r20161104a">2016/11/04 - [ports] nginx dynamic modules</h3>

The <tt>www/nginx</tt> port has been converted to use subpackages with dynamic
modules, instead of using FLAVORs.
If you previously were using a FLAVORed version of nginx, or the mail or stream
modules, you need to install the apropriate subpackage(s).
You also need to modify your nginx configuration to use <tt>load_module</tt> for
each dynamic module you want to load.


<h3 id="r20161109a">2016/11/09 - perl headers removed</h3>

The perl headers are no longer generated and should be removed:

<blockquote><pre>
rm -rf /usr/libdata/perl5/site_perl
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20161114">2016/11/14 - default lo(4) interface per rdomain</h3>

A loopback interface is now created by default for every
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rdomain.4">rdomain(4)</a>.
Much like <tt>lo0</tt> for rdomain 0, it can be used to see and filter local
traffic via <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/bpf.4">bpf(4)</a> and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a>.

<p>
If you previously were using an <tt>loX</tt> in an rdomain other than
<tt>X</tt>, it won't be possible to create rdomain <tt>X</tt> anymore.
You need to either use a different
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/lo.4">lo(4)</a> unit or
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rdomain.4">rdomain(4)</a> number.


<h3 id="r20161119">2016/11/19 - new dedicated build user</h3>

A dedicated user now does the heavy lifting of <tt>make build</tt>.

<p>
It is recommended that you start from a very recent <i>-current</i>
(dated after Nov 15), so you already have
<a href="http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/etc/master.passwd.diff?r1=1.93&amp;r2=1.94"
>a user <tt>build</tt></a> and
<a href="http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/etc/group.diff?r1=1.84&amp;r2=1.85"
>a group <tt>wobj</tt></a>,
otherwise add them manually.

<p>
Clean out the object directories and set correct owners and permissions:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rm -rf /usr/obj/* /usr/xobj/*</b>
# <b>chown build:wobj /usr/{,x}obj</b>
# <b>chmod 770 /usr/{,x}obj</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Developers <b>must</b> add their users to the group <tt>wobj</tt>, so that they
can still write to <tt>/usr/{,x}obj</tt>.
Be sure to remove any custom <tt>BUILDUSER</tt> from
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mk.conf">mk.conf(5)</a>.

<p>
Install the new systemwide makefiles:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You can now proceed by making and installing a kernel, rebooting and building
the system from source as described in the 
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/release">release(8)</a> man page.

<p>
Before making a release, ensure that <tt>build</tt> can write to
<tt>DESTDIR</tt> and <tt>RELEASEDIR</tt>: chown the root of the <tt>noperm</tt>
filesystem containing <tt>DESTDIR</tt>

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>chown build /dest</b>
</pre></blockquote>

and set ownership and permissions for <tt>RELEASEDIR</tt>

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>chown build $RELEASEDIR</b> 
# <b>chmod u=rwx $RELEASEDIR</b>
</pre></blockquote>

To avoid permission issues, it is recommended to start the first release with
an empty <tt>RELEASEDIR</tt>.

<p>
Making xenocara needs no extra steps beyond the ones described in
the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/release">release(8)</a> man page.


<h3 id="r20161201">2016/12/01 - cwm(1) bind function changes</h3>

The configuration syntax for binding functions to keys and mouse buttons has
changed, replacing the <tt>bind</tt> and <tt>mousebind</tt> keywords with
<tt>bind-key</tt>, <tt>bind-mouse</tt>, <tt>unbind-key</tt> and
<tt>unbind-mouse</tt>.
See the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cwmrc.5">cwmrc(5)</a> man page for new
bind function names.


<h3 id="r20161218">2016/12/18 - [ports] news/leafnode group change</h3>

The <tt>_news</tt> account used to run leafnode switched from the <tt>news</tt>
group to the <tt>_news</tt> group.
Ensure that you have at least <tt>leafnode-1.11.11p0</tt> installed and that
no <tt>leafnode</tt> process is running, then run

<blockquote><pre>
usermod -g _news _news
chgrp -R _news /var/spool/news/
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20161218a">2016/12/18 - [ports] net/uucp user change</h3>

Starting with <tt>uucp-1.07p4</tt>, the uucp suite now runs under the
<tt>_uucp</tt> account.
Ensure that you have no uucp process running, then adjust the ownership of some
files:

<blockquote><pre>
find /etc/ /var/spool/ -user uucp -exec chown _uucp {} ';'
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20161227a">2016/12/27 - removal of <tt>uucp</tt> and <tt>news</tt></h3>

The <tt>uucp</tt> user and the <tt>news</tt> group have been removed from base.
Issue

<blockquote><pre>
userdel uucp
groupdel news
rm -rf /var/spool/uucp*		# unless you use the net/uucp port
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20170103">2017/01/03 - https support added to the installer</h3>

On amd64, armv7, i386, hppa and macppc, the bsd.rd installer defaults to https.
Your <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/autoinstall">autoinstall(8)</a> response
file may need the additional line

<blockquote><pre>
Unable to connect using https. Use http instead = yes	# "no" is default
</pre></blockquote>

between the <tt>HTTP Server</tt> and <tt>Set name(s)</tt> responses.


<h3 id="r20170104">2017/01/04 - RFC5114 MODP groups removed from iked(8)</h3>

Support for the additional modular exponential groups specified in RFC5114 was
removed from <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>.
As a result, iked(8) will no longer accept proposals with the MODP2048-256 group
(grp24) and thus will not be able to act as a responder for clients running
OpenBSD 6.0 or earlier.
Therefore the configuration <b>on older installations</b> needs to be changed:
select a specific MODP group by adding a line such as
<tt>ikesa group modp2048 childsa group modp2048</tt> to be able to talk to
endpoints running newer versions.

<p>
For example, if the old configuration in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/iked.conf.5">iked.conf(5)</a> looked like this:

<blockquote><pre>
ikev2 active esp from 10.3.0.0/24 to 10.1.0.0/24 \
        local 192.168.1.1 peer 192.168.2.1 \
        childsa enc aes-128-gcm \
        psk "secret"
</pre></blockquote>

it needs to be amended to look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
ikev2 active esp from 10.3.0.0/24 to 10.1.0.0/24 \
        local 192.168.1.1 peer 192.168.2.1 \
	ikesa group modp2048 \
        childsa enc aes-128-gcm group modp2048 \
        psk "secret"
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20170121">2017/01/21 - acme-client(1) uses config file</h3>

The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a> program
now uses
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.conf.5">acme-client.conf(5)</a>.

<p>
Copy your account keys to the new location:

<blockquote><pre>
cp -p /etc/acme/privkey.pem /etc/acme/letsencrypt-privkey.pem
cp -p /etc/acme/privkey.pem /etc/acme/letsencrypt-staging-privkey.pem
</pre></blockquote>

It is recommended that you leave all current content of the new
<tt>/etc/acme-client.conf</tt> untouched and append your <tt>domain { }</tt>
sections.
This will make future upgrades easier.

<p>
For example, for the domain <tt>www.openbsd.org</tt>, append this to the file:

<blockquote><pre>
domain www.openbsd.org {
        alternative names { openbsd.org ftp.openbsd.org }
        domain key "/etc/ssl/acme/private/privkey.pem"
        domain certificate "/etc/ssl/acme/cert.pem"
        domain chain certificate "/etc/ssl/acme/chain.pem"
        domain full chain certificate "/etc/ssl/acme/fullchain.pem"
        #challengedir "/var/www/acme"
        sign with letsencrypt
}
</pre></blockquote>

What was previously achieved with the command
<tt>acme-client www.openbsd.org openbsd.org ftp.openbsd.org</tt>
can now be simplified to:

<blockquote><pre>
acme-client www.openbsd.org
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20170205">2017/02/05 - upgrade to perl 5.24.1</h3>

The perl distribution in the base system was upgraded to version 5.24.1.
A number of files and directories should be removed.
On slower architectures, check with <tt>perl -v</tt> that you do have the new
version before removing these files.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rm -rf \
  /usr/bin/perl5* \
  /usr/libdata/perl5/*-openbsd/5.*/ \
  /usr/bin/a2p \
  /usr/bin/config_data \

  /usr/bin/psed \
  /usr/bin/s2p \
  /usr/libdata/perl5/CGI* \

  /usr/libdata/perl5/unicore/lib/Perl/_XSpecia.pl \
  /usr/libdata/perl5/unicore/lib/Space \
  /usr/libdata/perl5/version/vpp.pm</b>
</pre></blockquote>

To remove any stale manpages, issue <b><tt>rm -rf /usr/share/man</tt></b> before
upgrading.


<h3 id="r20170210">2017/02/10 - [ports] mail/courier-authlib configuration change</h3>

A configuration change is needed to be able to use latest version of
<tt>mail/courier-authlib</tt>.
If MySQL or Postgresql is used as authentication source, the following lines
should be appended to the appropriate config files
(<tt>/etc/courier/authmysqlrc</tt> or <tt>/etc/courier/authpgsqlrc</tt>).

<blockquote><pre>
##NAME: MARKER:0
#
# Do not remove this section from this configuration file. This section
# must be present at the end of this file.
</pre></blockquote>

In addition, if MySQL is used, the option <tt>MYSQL_OPT 0</tt> should also be
set.


<h3 id="r20170226">2017/02/26 - switch from xdm(1) to xenodm(1)</h3>

The X Display Manager has been switched to
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/xenodm.1">xenodm(1)</a>.
If you enabled xdm in <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt>, you need to update your
configuration:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl disable xdm</b>
# <b>rcctl enable xenodm</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If any local configuration change was made to <tt>/etc/X11/xdm/</tt>, it should
be migrated to the corresponding <tt>/etc/X11/xenodm</tt> file.
After that the xdm files can be removed:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rm -rf /etc/X11/xdm</b>
# <b>rm /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm /usr/X11R6/man/man1/xdm.1 /etc/rc.d/xdm</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Your <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/autoinstall">autoinstall(8)</a> response
file may need to be adjusted since the xdm question was changed to:

<blockquote><pre>
Do you want the X Window System to be started by xenodm(1)
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="r20170227">2017/02/27 - pkg.conf(5) no longer supported</h3>

The <tt>pkg_*</tt> tools now use the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/installurl.5">installurl(5)</a> file to
find the main package repository.
Please create the <tt>/etc/installurl</tt> file manually with your preferred
<a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo 'https://your.mirror/pub/OpenBSD' > /etc/installurl</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Since the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pkg.conf.5">pkg.conf(5)</a> file
will no longer be used by tools, you may remove it:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rm /etc/pkg.conf</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Use the <tt>PKG_PATH</tt> environment variable in case you need to specify more
than one repository.
