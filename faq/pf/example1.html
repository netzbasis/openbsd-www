<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

This guide will show you how to turn an OpenBSD system into a router.
First, we'll define what this router (also called a "gateway") will actually
do, since your requirements may vary.

<ul>
  <li>Performing network address translation (NAT)
  <li>Giving a laptop and server static IPs based on their MAC address
  <li>Handing out IP addresses to other clients via DHCP
  <li>Allowing incoming connections to a local web server
  <li>Doing DNS caching for the LAN
  <li>Providing wireless connectivity
      (requires a <a href="../faq6.html#Wireless">supported card</a>)
</ul>

This example will use two <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/em">em(4)</a>
NICs and an <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/athn">athn(4)</a> wireless card.
Replace the <code>em0</code>, <code>em1</code> and <code>athn0</code>
interface names as appropriate.
Sample configuration files are provided, but you're encouraged to read
the man pages to understand their full capability.

<h2 id="net">Networking</h2>

We'll begin with some initial
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if">network configuration</a>,
using a <b>192.168.1.0/24</b> subnet for the wired clients and
<b>192.168.2.0/24</b> for the wireless.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>echo 'net.inet.ip.forwarding=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf</b>
# <b>echo 'dhcp' > /etc/hostname.em0</b> # if you have a static IP, use that instead
# <b>echo 'inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.255' > /etc/hostname.em1</b>
# <b>vi /etc/hostname.athn0</b>
</pre>

Add the following, changing the mode/channel if needed:

<pre class="cmdbox">
media autoselect mode 11n mediaopt hostap chan 1
nwid AccessPointName
wpakey VeryLongPassword
inet 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
</pre>

OpenBSD defaults to allowing only WPA2-CCMP connections in HostAP mode.
If you need support for older (insecure) protocols, they must be
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig#IEEE_802.11_(WIRELESS_DEVICES)">
explicitly enabled</a>.

<h2 id="dhcp">DHCP</h2>

Clients need IP addresses, so we'll set
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd">dhcpd(8)</a> to start on boot.
Configuration is done via the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.conf">dhcpd.conf(5)</a> file.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl enable dhcpd</b>
# <b>rcctl set dhcpd flags em1 athn0</b>
# <b>vi /etc/dhcpd.conf</b>
</pre>

Take this example and adjust to fit your needs:

<pre class="cmdbox">
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	option routers 192.168.1.1;
	option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
	range 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.254;
	host myserver {
		fixed-address 192.168.1.2;
		hardware ethernet 00:00:00:00:00:00;
	}
	host mylaptop {
		fixed-address 192.168.1.3;
		hardware ethernet 11:11:11:11:11:11;
	}
}
subnet 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	option routers 192.168.2.1;
	option domain-name-servers 192.168.2.1;
	range 192.168.2.2 192.168.2.254;
}
</pre>

You can specify another
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC 1918</a> address space here
if you prefer, or even a public IP block if you have one.
Using this example, clients will query a local DNS server, detailed in a later
section.
If you don't plan on using a local DNS server, replace the IPs in the
<code>domain-name-servers</code> lines with the address of your preferred
upstream resolver.

<h2 id="pf">Firewall</h2>

The centerpiece of this guide is the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a> file.
It's highly recommended to familiarize yourself with it, and PF in general,
before copying this example.
Each section will be explained in more detail.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>vi /etc/pf.conf</b>
</pre>

A configuration for a gateway system might look like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
wired = "em1"
wifi  = "athn0"
table &lt;martians&gt; { 0.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/8 127.0.0.0/8 169.254.0.0/16     \
	 	   172.16.0.0/12 192.0.0.0/24 192.0.2.0/24 224.0.0.0/3 \
	 	   192.168.0.0/16 198.18.0.0/15 198.51.100.0/24        \
	 	   203.0.113.0/24 }
set block-policy drop
set loginterface egress
set skip on lo0
match in all scrub (no-df random-id max-mss 1440)
match out on egress inet from !(egress:network) to any nat-to (egress:0)
antispoof quick for { egress $wired $wifi }
block in quick on egress from &lt;martians&gt; to any
block return out quick on egress from any to &lt;martians&gt;
block all
pass out quick inet
pass in on { $wired $wifi } inet
pass in on egress inet proto tcp from any to (egress) port { 80 443 } rdr-to 192.168.1.2
</pre>

Now we'll break this ruleset down and explain what each line does.

<pre class="cmdbox">
wired = "em1"
wifi  = "athn0"
</pre>

These are <a href="macros.html">macros</a>, used to make overall maintenance
easier.
Macros can be referenced throughout the ruleset after being defined.

<pre class="cmdbox">
table &lt;martians&gt; { 0.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/8 127.0.0.0/8 169.254.0.0/16     \
	 	   172.16.0.0/12 192.0.0.0/24 192.0.2.0/24 224.0.0.0/3 \
	 	   192.168.0.0/16 198.18.0.0/15 198.51.100.0/24        \
	 	   203.0.113.0/24 }
</pre>

This is a <a href="tables.html">table</a> of non-routable private addresses
that will be used later.

<pre class="cmdbox">
set block-policy drop
set loginterface egress
set skip on lo0
</pre>

PF allows certain <a href="options.html">options</a> to be set at runtime.
The <code>block-policy</code> decides whether rejected packets should return
a TCP RST or be silently dropped.
The <code>loginterface</code> is exactly what it sounds like: which interface
should have packet and byte statistics collection enabled.
These statistics can be viewed with the <code>pfctl -si</code> command.
In this case, we're using the <code>egress</code> group rather than a specific
interface.
The <code>egress</code> keyword automatically chooses the interface that holds
the default route, or the <code>em0</code> WAN interface in our example.
Finally, <code>skip</code> allows you to completely omit a given interface from
packet processing.
The firewall will ignore loopback traffic on the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lo">lo(4)</a> interface.

<pre class="cmdbox">
match in all scrub (no-df random-id max-mss 1440)
match out on egress inet from !(egress:network) to any nat-to (egress:0)
</pre>

The <code>match</code> rules used here accomplish two things:
normalizing incoming packets and performing network address translation,
with the <code>egress</code> interface between the LAN and the public internet.
For a more detailed explanation of <code>match</code> rules and their different
options, refer to the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>
manual.

<pre class="cmdbox">
antispoof quick for { egress $wired $wifi }
block in quick on egress from &lt;martians&gt; to any
block return out quick on egress from any to &lt;martians&gt;
</pre>

The <a href="filter.html#antispoof">antispoof</a> keyword provides some
protection from packets with spoofed source addresses.
Packets coming in on the <code>egress</code> interface should be dropped if they
appear to be from the list of unroutable addresses we defined.
Such packets were likely sent due to misconfiguration, or possibly as part of
a spoofing attack.
Similarly, our clients should not attempt to connect to such addresses.
We'll specify the "return" action to prevent annoying timeouts for users.
Note that this can cause problems if you're doing double NAT.

<pre class="cmdbox">
block all
</pre>

The firewall will set a "default deny" policy for all traffic.
This means we will only allow incoming and outgoing connections that we
explicitly put in our ruleset.

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass out quick inet
</pre>

Allow outgoing IPv4 traffic from both the gateway itself and the LAN clients.

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in on { $wired $wifi } inet
</pre>

Allow internal LAN traffic.

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in on egress inet proto tcp from any to (egress) port { 80 443 } rdr-to 192.168.1.2
</pre>

Forward incoming connections (on TCP ports 80 and 443, for a web server)
to our machine at 192.168.1.2.
This is merely an example of port forwarding.

<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>

At this point, clients should be assigned IP addresses and granted access to
the internet, while being protected by the firewall.
If that's all you need, you're done and can reboot now.
That being said, a DNS cache is common addition to a gateway system.

<p>
When clients issue a DNS query, they'll first hit the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unbound">unbound(8)</a> cache.
If it doesn't have the answer, it goes out to the upstream resolver that
you've configured.
Results are then fed to the client and cached for a period of time, making
future lookups of the same address quicker.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl enable unbound</b>
# <b>vi /var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf</b>
</pre>

Something like this should work for most setups:

<pre class="cmdbox">
server:
	interface: 192.168.1.1
	interface: 192.168.2.1
	interface: 127.0.0.1
	access-control: 192.168.1.0/24 allow
	access-control: 192.168.2.0/24 allow
	do-not-query-localhost: no
	hide-identity: yes
	hide-version: yes

forward-zone:
        name: "."
        forward-addr: 1.2.3.4  # IP of the upstream resolver
</pre>

Further configuration options can be found in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unbound.conf">unbound.conf(5)</a>.
Outgoing DNS lookups may also be encrypted with the <code>dnscrypt-proxy</code>
package -- see its included README file for details.

<p>
If you want the gateway to use the caching resolver for lookups too, don't
forget to change its <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file to point to 127.0.0.1.
Since the majority of routers won't be doing many DNS queries, this is likely
not needed.
Also note that it will need to be changed <i>back</i> to an actual resolver
when using <a href="../faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> for network-based upgrades
if you do so.
