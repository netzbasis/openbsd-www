<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
This guide will show you how to turn an ordinary OpenBSD box into a router.
First, we'll define what our router (also called a gateway) will actually do
in this context, since everyone has different requirements. In this example,
there are three computers that need to share an internet connection. One of
them is a web server that needs to be accessed remotely, but otherwise we
don't want any of the local systems open to the internet. The router will
be doing the following things:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Performing network address translation (NAT)
<li>Giving a laptop and server static IPs based on their MAC address
<li>Handing out IP addresses via DHCP to other clients
<li>Allowing (some) incoming connections to the server and gateway
<li>Optionally, doing local DNS caching and DNSCrypt
</ul>
<p>
We'll assume you've already got a standard OpenBSD installation. This guide
will be using hardware with four NICs that use the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=em">em(4)</a> driver,
so replace <tt>em0</tt>, <tt>em1</tt>, <tt>em2</tt> and <tt>em3</tt> with
the names of the interfaces in your system. Using this example, <tt>em0</tt>
will be for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network">WAN</a>
and the others for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network">LAN</a>.
Some sample configuration files are provided, but you're encouraged to read
the man pages of each one to understand their full capability.
<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="net">Networking</h2>
Two possible hardware setups are described on this page. The first details
an "all-in-one" solution in which clients will be directly connected to the
gateway, without the need for a switch. Software-based switching is done by
<a href="../faq6.html#Bridge">bridging</a> NICs with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=vether">vether(4)</a>
virtual interface. The second details the same thing, but using an external
(hardware) switch, rather than bridging. Only two interfaces are required in
that case. We'll begin with some initial
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=hostname.if">
network configuration</a>, using a <b>192.168.1.0/24</b> subnet.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo dhcp > /etc/hostname.em0</b> # if you have a static IP, use that instead
# <b>echo up   > /etc/hostname.em1</b>
# <b>echo up   > /etc/hostname.em2</b>
# <b>echo up   > /etc/hostname.em3</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If you plan on using 
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=bridge">bridge(4)</a>
for software-based switching, create the interfaces.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo 'inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.255' > /etc/hostname.vether0</b>
# <b>vi /etc/hostname.bridge0</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
And add the following lines:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
add vether0
add em1
add em2
add em3
blocknonip vether0
blocknonip em1
blocknonip em2
blocknonip em3
up
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If you plan on using a physical switch, give your secondary interface the
network information instead.
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo 'inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.255' > /etc/hostname.em1</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In either case, IP forwarding must be enabled to allow passing packets
between interfaces.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo 'net.inet.ip.forwarding=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This change will take effect upon the next reboot.
<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dhcp">DHCP</h2>
Clients need IP addresses, so we'll set 
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=dhcpd">dhcpd(8)</a>
to start on boot. Configuration is done via the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=dhcpd.conf">
dhcpd.conf(5)</a> file.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl enable dhcpd</b>
# <b>rcctl set dhcpd flags vether0</b> # replace vether0 with your secondary interface if not bridging
# <b>vi /etc/dhcpd.conf</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Take this example and adjust to fit your needs:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	option routers 192.168.1.1;
	range 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.254;
	host myserver {
		fixed-address 192.168.1.2;
		hardware ethernet 00:00:00:00:00:00;
		}
	host mylaptop {
		fixed-address 192.168.1.3;
		hardware ethernet 11:11:11:11:11:11;
		}
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Use the MAC addresses of certain clients if they require static IPs.
You can specify another <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">
RFC 1918</a> address space here if you prefer, or even a public IP block
if you have one. Using this example, clients will query a local DNS server,
detailed in a later section. If you don't plan on using a local DNS server,
replace <tt>192.168.1.1</tt> in the <tt>domain-name-servers</tt> line with the
address of your preferred upstream DNS server (<tt>8.8.8.8</tt>, for example).
<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pf">Firewall</h2>
The centerpiece of this guide is the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>
file. It's highly recommended to familiarize yourself with it, and
<a href="index.html">PF in general</a>, before copying this example.
Each section will be explained in more detail.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>vi /etc/pf.conf</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
A configuration for a gateway system might look like this:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
int_if="{ vether0 em1 em2 em3 }"
table &lt;martians&gt; { 0.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/8 127.0.0.0/8 169.254.0.0/16     \
	 	   172.16.0.0/12 192.0.0.0/24 192.0.2.0/24 224.0.0.0/3 \
	 	   192.168.0.0/16 198.18.0.0/15 198.51.100.0/24        \
	 	   203.0.113.0/24 }
set block-policy drop
set loginterface egress
set skip on lo0
match in all scrub (no-df random-id max-mss 1440)
match out on egress inet from !(egress:network) to any nat-to (egress:0)
block in quick on egress from &lt;martians&gt; to any
block return out quick on egress from any to &lt;martians&gt;
block all
pass out quick inet
pass in on $int_if inet
pass in on egress inet proto tcp from any to (egress) port 22
pass in on egress inet proto tcp from any to (egress) port { 80 443 } rdr-to 192.168.1.2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Now we'll break this ruleset down and explain what each section is for.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
int_if="{ vether0 em1 em2 em3 }"
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is a <a href="macros.html">macro</a>, used to make overall maintenance
easier. Macros can be referenced throughout the ruleset after being defined.
The <tt>int_if</tt> macro is a list of internal interfaces, including the
virtual ethernet interface. If you're using an external switch instead of
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=bridge">bridge(4)</a>,
replace <tt>{ vether0 em1 em2 em3 }</tt> with your secondary interface name.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
table &lt;martians&gt; { 0.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/8 127.0.0.0/8 169.254.0.0/16     \
	 	   172.16.0.0/12 192.0.0.0/24 192.0.2.0/24 224.0.0.0/3 \
	 	   192.168.0.0/16 198.18.0.0/15 198.51.100.0/24        \
	 	   203.0.113.0/24 }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is a <a href="tables.html">table</a> of non-routable private addresses
that will be used later.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
set block-policy drop
set loginterface egress
set skip on lo0
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
PF allows certain <a href="options.html">options</a> to be set at runtime.
The <tt>block-policy</tt> decides whether rejected packets should return
a TCP RST or be silently dropped. The <tt>loginterface</tt> is exactly
what it sounds like: which interface should have packet and byte statistics
collection enabled. These statistics can be viewed with the <tt>pfctl -si</tt>
command. In this case, we're using the <tt>egress</tt> group rather than
a specific interface. The <tt>egress</tt> keyword automatically chooses the
interface that holds the default route, or the <tt>em0</tt> WAN interface in
our example. Finally, <tt>skip</tt> allows you to completely omit a given
interface from packet processing. The firewall will ignore loopback traffic
on the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=lo">lo(4)</a>
interface.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
match in all scrub (no-df random-id max-mss 1440)
match out on egress inet from !(egress:network) to any nat-to (egress:0)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>match</tt> rules used here accomplish two things: normalizing incoming
packets and performing network address translation, with the <tt>egress</tt>
interface between the LAN and the public internet. For a more detailed
explanation of <tt>match</tt> rules and their different options, refer to the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>
manual.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
block in quick on egress from &lt;martians&gt; to any
block return out quick on egress from any to &lt;martians&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Packets coming in on the <tt>egress</tt> interface should be dropped if they
appear to be from the list of unroutable addresses we defined. Such packets
were likely sent due to misconfiguration, or possibly as part of a spoofing
attack. Similarly, our clients should not attempt to connect to such addresses.
We'll specify the "return" action to prevent annoying timeouts for users.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
block all
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The firewall will set a "default deny" policy for all traffic. This means we
will only allow incoming and outgoing connections that we explicitly put in
our ruleset.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
pass out quick inet
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
With the previous rule in mind, there are obviously some types of traffic we
want to <tt>pass</tt> in our setup. This line allows outgoing IPv4 traffic
from both the gateway itself and the LAN clients.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
pass in on $int_if inet
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Allow all internal LAN traffic to pass.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
pass in on egress inet proto tcp from any to (egress) port 22
pass in on egress inet proto tcp from any to (egress) port { 80 443 } rdr-to 192.168.1.2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Allow incoming connections to the router itself (on TCP port 22, for SSH)
and forward incoming connections (on TCP ports 80 and 443, for a web server)
to our machine at 192.168.1.2. This is merely an example of port forwarding.
<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
At this point, clients should be assigned IP addresses and granted access to
the internet, while being protected by the firewall. If that's all you need,
you're done and can reboot now. With that said, a common addition to a
gateway system is a DNS cache.
<p>
Setting up local DNS caching is very simple with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=unbound">unbound(8)</a>.
Outgoing lookups can optionally be encrypted with
<a href="https://dnscrypt.org/">dnscrypt-proxy</a>, installed from the OpenBSD
<a href="faq15.html">package system</a>. When clients issue a DNS query,
they'll first hit the cache. If unbound doesn't have the answer, it goes out
(via an encrypted channel, if using dnscrypt-proxy) to the upstream resolver
that you've configured. Results are then fed to the client and cached for a
period of time, making future lookups of the same address much quicker. 
If you choose to use DNSCrypt, be aware that you are trusting whichever
upstream resolver is used to provide accurate responses.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl enable unbound</b>
# <b>vi /var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Something like this should work for most setups:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
server:
	interface: 192.168.1.1
	interface: 127.0.0.1
	access-control: 192.168.1.0/24 allow
	do-not-query-localhost: no
	hide-identity: yes
	hide-version: yes

forward-zone:
        name: "."
        forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@40
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Further configuration options can be found in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=unbound.conf">
unbound.conf(5)</a>. Now we'll set up dnscrypt-proxy. It's <b>not</b> part
of the base system, so you need to install it from packages. If you'd like
to use a normal authoritative DNS server instead, replace <tt>127.0.0.1@40</tt>
in the <tt>forward-addr</tt> line with the address of the server you want
to use (<tt>8.8.8.8@53</tt>, for example). Otherwise, it's just a matter of
installing the tool and choosing a resolver.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>export PKG_PATH=http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/$(uname -r)/packages/$(uname -m)</b>
# <b>pkg_add dnscrypt-proxy</b>
# <b>rcctl enable dnscrypt_proxy</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The dnscrypt-proxy utility won't use any server (and thus won't work) by
default; you need to specify one with the <tt>-R</tt> flag. The
<a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv">
included documentation</a> has a list of supported resolvers. We'll set it
to listen for connections on localhost, port 40.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl set dnscrypt_proxy flags -l /dev/null -R dnscrypt.eu-dk -a 127.0.0.1:40</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If you're using DNSCrypt to prevent information leakage, the following
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>
rule may be used as an additional safety belt:
<blockquote><pre>
block return in log on $int_if inet proto { tcp udp } from any to ! 192.168.1.1 port 53
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
As configured in a previous section, our DHCP server will give users a default
DNS address to query. Unless they explicitly define another public DNS server,
all the outgoing lookups should be encrypted. This PF rule will block any
outgoing connections on port 53 if they aren't destined for our DNS cache.
The <tt>log</tt> keyword is used so that the admin can easily investigate
such connections with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=pflogd">pflogd(8)</a>.
<p>
If you want the gateway to use the caching resolver for lookups too, don't
forget to change its <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> file to point to 127.0.0.1.
Since the majority of routers won't be doing many DNS queries, this is likely
not needed. Also note that it will need to be changed <i>back</i> to an actual
resolver when using <a href="../faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> for network-based
upgrades if you do so.
