<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

This guide will show you how to turn an OpenBSD system into a router.
First, we'll define what this router (also called a "gateway") will actually
do, since your requirements may vary.
In this example, three computers need to share an internet connection.
One of them is a web server that should be remotely accessible, but otherwise
we don't want any of the local systems open to the internet.
The router will be doing the following things:

<ul>
  <li>Performing network address translation (NAT)
  <li>Giving a laptop and server static IPs based on their MAC address
  <li>Handing out IP addresses via DHCP to other clients
  <li>Allowing incoming connections to the web server and the router's
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>
  <li>Doing local DNS caching for the LAN, optionally
</ul>

This guide will be using hardware with four NICs that use the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/em">em(4)</a> driver, so replace <tt>em0</tt>,
<tt>em1</tt>, <tt>em2</tt> and <tt>em3</tt> with the names of the interfaces
in your system.
Using this example, <tt>em0</tt> will be for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network">WAN</a>
and the others will be for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network">LAN</a>.
Some sample configuration files are provided, but you're encouraged to read
the man pages to understand their full capability.

<h2 id="net">Networking</h2>

Two possible hardware setups are described on this page:

<ul>
  <li>An "all-in-one" solution in which clients will be directly connected
      to the gateway, without the need for a switch.
      Software-based switching is done by
      <a href="../faq6.html#Bridge">bridging</a> NICs with the
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vether">vether(4)</a> virtual interface.
      You'll need an available ethernet port for each client machine with
      this type of setup.
  <li>A more traditional approach that uses an external (hardware) switch
      rather than bridging.
      Only two interfaces will be needed in that case.
</ul>

We'll begin with some initial
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if">network configuration</a>,
using a <b>192.168.1.0/24</b> subnet.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo dhcp > /etc/hostname.em0</b> # if you have a static IP, use that instead
# <b>echo up   > /etc/hostname.em1</b>
# <b>echo up   > /etc/hostname.em2</b>
# <b>echo up   > /etc/hostname.em3</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If you plan on using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bridge">bridge(4)</a>
for software-based switching, create the interfaces.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo 'inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.255' > /etc/hostname.vether0</b>
# <b>vi /etc/hostname.bridge0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

And add the following lines:

<blockquote><pre>
add vether0
add em1
add em2
add em3
blocknonip vether0
blocknonip em1
blocknonip em2
blocknonip em3
up
</pre></blockquote>

If you plan on using a physical switch, give your secondary interface the
network information instead.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo 'inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.255' > /etc/hostname.em1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

In either case, IP forwarding must be enabled to allow passing packets
between interfaces.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo 'net.inet.ip.forwarding=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This change will take effect upon the next reboot.

<h2 id="dhcp">DHCP</h2>

Clients need IP addresses, so we'll set
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd">dhcpd(8)</a> to start on boot.
Configuration is done via the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.conf">dhcpd.conf(5)</a> file.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl enable dhcpd</b>
# <b>rcctl set dhcpd flags vether0</b> # replace vether0 with your secondary interface if not bridging
# <b>vi /etc/dhcpd.conf</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Take this example and adjust to fit your needs:

<blockquote><pre>
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	option routers 192.168.1.1;
	option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
	range 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.254;
	host myserver {
		fixed-address 192.168.1.2;
		hardware ethernet 00:00:00:00:00:00;
		}
	host mylaptop {
		fixed-address 192.168.1.3;
		hardware ethernet 11:11:11:11:11:11;
		}
}
</pre></blockquote>

Use the MAC addresses of certain clients if they require static IPs.
You can specify another
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC 1918</a> address space here
if you prefer, or even a public IP block if you have one.
Using this example, clients will query a local DNS server, detailed in a later
section.
If you don't plan on using a local DNS server, replace <tt>192.168.1.1</tt>
in the <tt>domain-name-servers</tt> line with the address of your preferred
upstream DNS server (<tt>8.8.8.8</tt>, for example).
If you want to use multiple subnets, the
<a href="../faq6.html#DHCPserver">networking FAQ</a> has an example of that.

<h2 id="pf">Firewall</h2>

The centerpiece of this guide is the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a> file.
It's highly recommended to familiarize yourself with it, and PF in general,
before copying this example.
Each section will be explained in more detail.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>vi /etc/pf.conf</b>
</pre></blockquote>

A configuration for a gateway system might look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
int_if="{ vether0 em1 em2 em3 }"
table &lt;martians&gt; { 0.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/8 127.0.0.0/8 169.254.0.0/16     \
	 	   172.16.0.0/12 192.0.0.0/24 192.0.2.0/24 224.0.0.0/3 \
	 	   192.168.0.0/16 198.18.0.0/15 198.51.100.0/24        \
	 	   203.0.113.0/24 }
set block-policy drop
set loginterface egress
set skip on lo0
match in all scrub (no-df random-id max-mss 1440)
match out on egress inet from !(egress:network) to any nat-to (egress:0)
block in quick on egress from &lt;martians&gt; to any
block return out quick on egress from any to &lt;martians&gt;
block all
pass out quick inet
pass in on $int_if inet
pass in on egress inet proto tcp from any to (egress) port 22
pass in on egress inet proto tcp from any to (egress) port { 80 443 } rdr-to 192.168.1.2
</pre></blockquote>

Now we'll break this ruleset down and explain what each line does.

<blockquote><pre>
int_if="{ vether0 em1 em2 em3 }"
</pre></blockquote>

This is a <a href="macros.html">macro</a>, used to make overall maintenance
easier.
Macros can be referenced throughout the ruleset after being defined.
The <tt>int_if</tt> macro is a list of internal interfaces, including the
virtual ethernet interface.
If you're using an external switch instead of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bridge">bridge(4)</a>, replace <tt>{ vether0
em1 em2 em3 }</tt> with your secondary interface name.

<blockquote><pre>
table &lt;martians&gt; { 0.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/8 127.0.0.0/8 169.254.0.0/16     \
	 	   172.16.0.0/12 192.0.0.0/24 192.0.2.0/24 224.0.0.0/3 \
	 	   192.168.0.0/16 198.18.0.0/15 198.51.100.0/24        \
	 	   203.0.113.0/24 }
</pre></blockquote>

This is a <a href="tables.html">table</a> of non-routable private addresses
that will be used later.

<blockquote><pre>
set block-policy drop
set loginterface egress
set skip on lo0
</pre></blockquote>

PF allows certain <a href="options.html">options</a> to be set at runtime.
The <tt>block-policy</tt> decides whether rejected packets should return
a TCP RST or be silently dropped.
The <tt>loginterface</tt> is exactly what it sounds like: which interface
should have packet and byte statistics collection enabled.
These statistics can be viewed with the <tt>pfctl -si</tt> command.
In this case, we're using the <tt>egress</tt> group rather than a specific
interface.
The <tt>egress</tt> keyword automatically chooses the interface that holds
the default route, or the <tt>em0</tt> WAN interface in our example.
Finally, <tt>skip</tt> allows you to completely omit a given interface from
packet processing.
Here, the firewall will ignore loopback traffic on the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lo">lo(4)</a> interface.

<blockquote><pre>
match in all scrub (no-df random-id max-mss 1440)
match out on egress inet from !(egress:network) to any nat-to (egress:0)
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>match</tt> rules used here accomplish two things: normalizing incoming
packets and performing network address translation, with the <tt>egress</tt>
interface between the LAN and the public internet.
For a more detailed explanation of <tt>match</tt> rules and their different
options, refer to the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>
manual.

<blockquote><pre>
block in quick on egress from &lt;martians&gt; to any
block return out quick on egress from any to &lt;martians&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

Packets coming in on the <tt>egress</tt> interface should be dropped if they
appear to be from the list of unroutable addresses we defined.
Such packets were likely sent due to misconfiguration, or possibly as part of
a spoofing attack.
Similarly, our clients should not attempt to connect to such addresses.
We'll specify the "return" action to prevent annoying timeouts for users.
Note that this can cause problems if you're doing double NAT.

<blockquote><pre>
block all
</pre></blockquote>

The firewall will set a "default deny" policy for all traffic.
This means we will only allow incoming and outgoing connections that we
explicitly put in our ruleset.

<blockquote><pre>
pass out quick inet
</pre></blockquote>

With the previous rule in mind, there are obviously some types of traffic we
want to <tt>pass</tt> in our setup.
This line allows outgoing IPv4 traffic from both the gateway itself and the
LAN clients.

<blockquote><pre>
pass in on $int_if inet
</pre></blockquote>

Allow all internal LAN traffic to pass.

<blockquote><pre>
pass in on egress inet proto tcp from any to (egress) port 22
pass in on egress inet proto tcp from any to (egress) port { 80 443 } rdr-to 192.168.1.2
</pre></blockquote>

Allow incoming connections to the router itself (on TCP port 22, for SSH)
and forward incoming connections (on TCP ports 80 and 443, for a web server)
to our machine at 192.168.1.2.
This is merely an example of port forwarding.

<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>

At this point, clients should be assigned IP addresses and granted access to
the internet, while being protected by the firewall.
If that's all you need, you're done and can reboot now.
With that said, a common addition to a gateway system is a DNS cache.

<p>
Setting up local DNS caching is very simple with
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unbound">unbound(8)</a>.
When clients issue a DNS query, they'll first hit the cache.
If unbound doesn't have the answer, it goes out to the upstream resolver
that you've configured.
Results are then fed to the client and cached for a period of time, making
future lookups of the same address much quicker.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl enable unbound</b>
# <b>vi /var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Something like this should work for most setups:

<blockquote><pre>
server:
	interface: 192.168.1.1
	interface: 127.0.0.1
	access-control: 192.168.1.0/24 allow
	do-not-query-localhost: no
	hide-identity: yes
	hide-version: yes

forward-zone:
        name: "."
        forward-addr: IP.OF.UPSTREAM.RESOLVER
</pre></blockquote>

Further configuration options can be found in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unbound.conf">unbound.conf(5)</a>.
Outgoing DNS lookups may also be encrypted with the <tt>dnscrypt-proxy</tt>
package -- see its included README file for details.

<p>
If you want the gateway to use the caching resolver for lookups too, don't
forget to change its <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> file to point to 127.0.0.1.
Since the majority of routers won't be doing many DNS queries, this is likely
not needed.
Also note that it will need to be changed <i>back</i> to an actual resolver
when using <a href="../faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> for network-based upgrades
if you do so.
