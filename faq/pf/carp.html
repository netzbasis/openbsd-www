<h2 id="carpintro">Introduction to CARP</h2>

CARP is the Common Address Redundancy Protocol.
Its primary purpose is to allow multiple hosts on the same network segment
to share an IP address.
CARP is a secure, free alternative to the
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3768.txt">Virtual Router Redundancy
Protocol</a> (VRRP) and the
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2281.txt">Hot Standby Router Protocol</a>
(HSRP).

<p>
CARP works by allowing a group of hosts on the same network segment to
share an IP address.
This group of hosts is referred to as a "redundancy group."
The redundancy group is assigned an IP address that is shared amongst
the group members.
Within the group, one host is designated the "master" and the rest as
"backups."
The master host is the one that currently "holds" the shared IP; it
responds to any traffic or ARP requests directed towards it.
Each host may belong to more than one redundancy group at a time.

<p>
One common use for CARP is to create a group of redundant firewalls.
The virtual IP that is assigned to the redundancy group is configured on
client machines as the default gateway.
In the event that the master firewall suffers a failure or is taken
offline, the IP will move to one of the backup firewalls and service
will continue unaffected.

<p>
CARP supports IPv4 and IPv6.

<h2 id="carpop">CARP operation</h2>

The master host in the group sends regular advertisements to the local
network so that the backup hosts know it's still alive.
If the backup hosts don't hear an advertisement from the master for a
set period of time, then one of them will take over the duties of master
(whichever backup host has the lowest configured <tt>advbase</tt> and
<tt>advskew</tt> values).

<p>
It's possible for multiple CARP groups to exist on the same network segment.
CARP advertisements contain the Virtual Host ID which allows group
members to identify which redundancy group the advertisement belongs to.

<p>
In order to prevent a malicious user on the network segment from spoofing
CARP advertisements, each group can be configured with a password.
Each CARP packet sent to the group is then protected by an SHA1 HMAC.

<p>
Since CARP is its own protocol, it should have an explicit pass rule in
filter rulesets:

<blockquote><pre>
pass out on $carp_dev proto carp
</pre></blockquote>

<tt>$carp_dev</tt> should be the physical interface that CARP is
communicating over.

<h2 id="carpconfig">Configuring CARP</h2>

Each redundancy group is represented by a
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/carp">carp(4)</a> virtual network interface.
As such, CARP is configured using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a>.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ifconfig <i>carpN</i> create</b>
# <b>ifconfig <i>carpN</i> vhid <i>vhid</i> [pass <i>password</i>] [carpdev <i>carpdev</i>] \
   [advbase <i>advbase</i>] [advskew <i>advskew</i>] [state <i>state</i>] [group|-group <i>group</i>] \
   <i>ipaddress</i> netmask <i>mask</i></b>
</pre></blockquote>
<!-- XXX someone who understands carpnodes should add a piece -->

<dl>
<dt><tt><i>carpN</i></tt>
<dd>The name of the carp(4) virtual interface where <i>N</i> is an
    integer that represents the interface's number (e.g. carp10).

<dt><tt><i>vhid</i></tt>
<dd>The Virtual Host ID.
    This is a unique number that is used to identify the redundancy group to
    other nodes in the group, and to distinguish between groups on the same
    network.
    Acceptable values are from 1 to 255.
    This must be the same on all members of the group.

<dt><tt><i>password</i></tt>
<dd>The authentication password to use when talking to other CARP-enabled
    hosts in this redundancy group.
    This must be the same on all members of the group.

<dt><tt><i>carpdev</i></tt>
<dd>This optional parameter specifies the physical network interface that
    belongs to this redundancy group.
    By default, CARP will try to determine which interface to use by
    looking for a physical interface that is in the same subnet as the
    <i>ipaddress</i> and <i>mask</i> combination given to the carp(4)
    interface.

<dt><tt><i>advbase</i></tt>
<dd>This optional parameter specifies how often, in seconds, to advertise
    that we're a member of the redundancy group.
    The default is 1 second.
    Acceptable values are from 1 to 255.

<dt><tt><i>advskew</i></tt>
<dd>This optional parameter specifies how much to skew the
    <tt><i>advbase</i></tt> when sending CARP advertisements.
    By manipulating <tt><i>advskew</i></tt>, the master CARP host can be
    chosen.
    The higher the number, the <i>less</i> preferred the host will be when
    choosing a master.
    The default is 0.
    Acceptable values are from 0 to 254.

<dt><tt><i>state</i></tt>
<dd>Force a carp(4) interface into a certain state.
    Valid states are <tt>init</tt>, <tt>backup</tt>, and <tt>master</tt>.

<dt><tt><i>group</i>, <i>-group</i></tt>
<dd>Add or remove a carp(4) interface to a certain interface group.
    By default, all carp(4) interfaces are added to the <tt>carp</tt> group.
    Each group has a <tt>carpdemote</tt> counter affecting all carp(4)
    interfaces belonging to that group.
    As described below, it can be useful to group certain interfaces together
    for failover purposes.

<dt><tt><i>ipaddress</i></tt>
<dd>This is the shared IP address assigned to the redundancy group.
    This address does not have to be in the same subnet as the IP address on
    the physical interface (if present).
    This address needs to be the same on all hosts in the group, however.

<dt><tt><i>mask</i></tt>
<dd>The subnet mask of the shared IP.
</dl>

<p>
Further CARP behavior can be controlled via
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sysctl">sysctl(8)</a>.

<dl>
<dt><tt>net.inet.carp.allow</tt>
<dd>Accept incoming CARP packets or not.
    Default is 1 (yes).

<dt><tt>net.inet.carp.preempt</tt>
<dd>Allow hosts within a redundancy group that have a better
    <tt>advbase</tt> and <tt>advskew</tt> to preempt the master.
    In addition, this option also enables failing over a group of interfaces
    together in the event that one interface goes down.
    If one physical CARP-enabled interface goes down, CARP will increase
    the demotion counter, <tt>carpdemote</tt>, by 1 on interface groups that
    the carp(4) interface is a member of, in effect causing all group
    members to fail-over together.
    <tt>net.inet.carp.preempt</tt> is 0 (disabled) by default.

<dt><tt>net.inet.carp.log</tt>
<dd>Log state changes, bad packets and other errors.
    This value may be between 0 and 7, corresponding with syslog(3) priorities.
    The default is 2 (state changes only).
</dl>

<h2 id="carpex">CARP example</h2>

Here is an example CARP configuration:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>sysctl net.inet.carp.allow=1</b>
# <b>echo 'net.inet.carp.allow=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf</b>
# <b>ifconfig carp1 create</b>
# <b>ifconfig carp1 vhid 1 pass mekmitasdigoat carpdev em0 advskew 100 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This sets up the following:

<ul>
  <li>Enables receipt of CARP packets (this is the default setting).
  <li>Creates a carp(4) interface, <tt>carp1</tt>.
  <li>Configures <tt>carp1</tt> for virtual host #1, enables a password,
      sets <tt>em0</tt> as the interface belonging to the group, and makes
      this host a backup due to the <tt>advskew</tt> of <tt>100</tt>
      (assuming of course that the master is set up with an <tt>advskew</tt>
      less than 100).
      The shared IP assigned to this group is 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.0.
</ul>

Running <tt>ifconfig</tt> on <tt>carp1</tt> shows the status of the interface.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ifconfig carp1</b>
carp1: flags=8802&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
     carp: BACKUP carpdev em0 vhid 1 advbase 1 advskew 100
     groups: carp
     inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="pfsyncintro">Introduction to pfsync</h2>

The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pfsync">pfsync(4)</a> network interface
exposes certain changes made to the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pf">pf(4)</a> state table.
By monitoring this device using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump">tcpdump(8)</a>, state table changes
can be observed in real time.
In addition, the pfsync(4) interface can send these state change messages out
on the network so that other nodes running PF can merge the changes into their
own state tables.
Likewise, pfsync(4) can also listen on the network for incoming messages.

<h2 id="pfsyncop">pfsync operation</h2>

By default, pfsync(4) does not send or receive state table updates
on the network; however, updates can still be monitored using tcpdump(8)
or other such tools on the local machine.

<p>
When pfsync(4) is set up to send and receive updates on the network,
the default behavior is to multicast updates out on the local network.
All updates are sent without authentication.
Best common practice is either:

<ol>
  <li>Connect the two nodes that will be exchanging updates back-to-back
      using a crossover cable and use that interface as the
  <tt>syncdev</tt> (see <a href="#pfsyncconfig">below</a>).
  <li>Use the ifconfig(8) <tt>syncpeer</tt> option (see
      <a href="#pfsyncconfig">below</a>) so that updates are unicast directly
      to the peer, then configure
      <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ipsec">ipsec(4)</a> between the hosts
      to secure the pfsync(4) traffic.
</ol>

When updates are being sent and received on the network, pfsync packets
should be passed in the filter ruleset:

<blockquote><pre>
pass on $sync_if proto pfsync
</pre></blockquote>

<tt>$sync_if</tt> should be the physical interface that pfsync(4) is
communicating over.

<h2 id="pfsyncconfig">Configuring pfsync</h2>

Since pfsync(4) is a virtual network interface, it is configured using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a>.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ifconfig <i>pfsyncN</i> syncdev <i>syncdev</i> [syncpeer <i>syncpeer</i>] [defer|-defer]</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<dl>
<dt><tt><i>pfsyncN</i></tt>
<dd>The name of the pfsync(4) interface.
    <tt>pfsync0</tt> exists by default when using the <tt>GENERIC</tt> kernel.

<dt><tt><i>syncdev</i></tt>
<dd>The name of the physical interface used to send pfsync updates out.

<dt><tt><i>syncpeer</i></tt>
<dd>This optional parameter specifies the IP address of a host to exchange
    pfsync updates with.
    By default, pfsync updates are multicast on the local network.
    This option overrides that behavior and instead unicasts the update to
    the specified <tt><i>syncpeer</i></tt>.

<dt><tt><i>defer</i></tt>
<dd>If the <tt>defer</tt> flag is used, the initial packet of a new connection
    passing through the firewall will not be transmitted until either another
    pfsync(4) system has acknowledged the state table addition, or a timeout
    has expired.
    This adds small delays but allows traffic to flow when more than one
    firewall might actively handle packets ("active/active"), e.g. with
    certain ospfd(8), bgpd(8) or carp(4) configurations.
</dl>

<h2 id="pfsyncex">pfsync example</h2>

Here is an example pfsync configuration:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ifconfig pfsync0 syncdev em1 up</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This enables pfsync on the <tt>em1</tt> interface.
Outgoing updates will be multicast on the network allowing any other
host running pfsync to receive them.

<h2 id="failover">Combining CARP and pfsync for failover</h2>

By combining the features of CARP and pfsync, a group of two or more
firewalls can be used to create a highly-available, fully redundant
firewall cluster.

<dl>
<dt>CARP:
<dd>Handles the automatic failover of one firewall to another.

<dt>pfsync:
<dd>Synchronizes the state table amongst all the firewalls.
    In the event of a failover, traffic can flow uninterrupted through the
    new master firewall.
</dl>

<p>
An example scenario.
Two firewalls, <tt>fw1</tt> and <tt>fw2</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
         +----| WAN/Internet |----+
         |                        |
      em2|                        |em2
      +-----+                  +-----+
      | fw1 |-em1----------em1-| fw2 |
      +-----+                  +-----+
      em0|                        |em0
         |                        |
      ---+-------Shared LAN-------+---
</pre></blockquote>

The firewalls are connected back-to-back using a crossover cable on
<tt>em1</tt>.
Both are connected to the LAN on <tt>em0</tt> and to a WAN/Internet
connection on <tt>em2</tt>.
IP addresses are as follows:

<ul>
  <li>fw1 em0: 172.16.0.1
  <li>fw1 em1: 10.10.10.1
  <li>fw1 em2: 192.0.2.1
  <li>fw2 em0: 172.16.0.2
  <li>fw2 em1: 10.10.10.2
  <li>fw2 em2: 192.0.2.2
  <li>LAN shared IP: 172.16.0.100
  <li>WAN/internet shared IP: 192.0.2.100
</ul>

The network policy is that <tt>fw1</tt> will be the preferred master.

<p>
Configure fw1:

<blockquote><pre>
! enable preemption and group interface failover
# <b>sysctl net.inet.carp.preempt=1</b>
# <b>echo 'net.inet.carp.preempt=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf</b>

! configure pfsync
# <b>ifconfig em1 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0</b>
# <b>ifconfig pfsync0 syncdev em1</b>
# <b>ifconfig pfsync0 up</b>

! configure CARP on the LAN side
# <b>ifconfig carp1 create</b>
# <b>ifconfig carp1 vhid 1 carpdev em0 pass lanpasswd \

# <b>ifconfig carp2 create</b>
# <b>ifconfig carp2 vhid 2 carpdev em2 pass netpasswd \
     192.0.2.100 netmask 255.255.255.0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Configure fw2:

<blockquote><pre>

# <b>ifconfig pfsync0 up</b>

! configure CARP on the LAN side
# <b>ifconfig carp1 create</b>
# <b>ifconfig carp1 vhid 1 carpdev em0 pass lanpasswd \
     advskew 128 172.16.0.100 netmask 255.255.255.0</b>

# <b>ifconfig carp2 create</b>
# <b>ifconfig carp2 vhid 2 carpdev em2 pass netpasswd \
     advskew 128 192.0.2.100 netmask 255.255.255.0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="ops">Operational issues</h2>

Some common operational issues encountered with CARP/pfsync.

<h3 id="bootconfig">Configuring CARP and pfsync during boot</h3>

Since carp(4) and pfsync(4) are both types of network interfaces, they
can be configured at boot by creating a
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if">hostname.if(5)</a> file.
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/netstart">netstart</a> startup script
will take care of creating the interface and configuring it.

<p>
Examples:

<dl>
<dt>/etc/hostname.carp1</dt>
<dd>
inet 172.16.0.100 255.255.255.0 172.16.0.255 vhid 1 carpdev em0 pass lanpasswd
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>/etc/hostname.pfsync0</dt>
<dd>
up syncdev em1
</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="forcefail">Forcing failover of the master</h3>

There can be times when it's necessary to failover or demote the master
node on purpose.
Examples include taking the master node down for maintenance or when
troubleshooting a problem.
The objective here is to gracefully fail over traffic to one of the
backup hosts so that users do not notice any impact.

<p>
To failover a particular CARP group, shut down the carp(4) interface on the
master node.
This will cause the master to advertise itself with an "infinite"
<tt>advbase</tt> and <tt>advskew</tt>.
The backup host(s) will see this and immediately take over the role of master.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ifconfig carp1 down</b>
</pre></blockquote>

An alternative is to increase the <tt>advskew</tt> to a value that's
higher than the <tt>advskew</tt> on the backup host(s).
This will cause a failover but still allow the master to participate in
the CARP group.

<p>
Another method of failover is to tweak the CARP demotion counter.
The demotion counter is a measure of how "ready" a host is to become master
of a CARP group.
For example, while a host is in the middle of booting up it's a bad idea
for it to become the CARP master until all interfaces have been configured,
all network daemons have been started, etc.
Hosts advertising a high demotion value will be less preferred as the master.

<p>
A demotion counter is stored in each interface group that the CARP interface
belongs to.
By default, all CARP interfaces are members of the "carp" interface group.
The current value of a demotion counter can be viewed using ifconfig(8):

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ifconfig -g carp</b>
carp: carp demote count 0
</pre></blockquote>

In this example, the counter associated with the "carp" interface group is
shown.
When a CARP host advertises itself on the network, it takes the sum of
the demotion counters for each interface group the carp(4) interface
belongs to and advertises that value as its demotion value.

<p>
Now assume the following example.
Two firewalls running CARP with the following CARP interfaces:

<ul>
  <li>carp1 -- Accounting Department
  <li>carp2 -- Regular Employees
  <li>carp3 -- Internet
  <li>carp4 -- DMZ
</ul>

The objective is to failover just the carp1 and carp2 groups to the
secondary firewall.

<p>
First, assign each to a new interface group, in this case named "internal":

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ifconfig carp1 group internal</b>
# <b>ifconfig carp2 group internal</b>
# <b>ifconfig internal</b>
carp1: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
     carp: MASTER carpdev em0 vhid 1 advbase 1 advskew 100
     groups: carp internal
     inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255
carp2: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
     carp: MASTER carpdev em1 vhid 2 advbase 1 advskew 100
     groups: carp internal
     inet 10.0.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.1.255
</pre></blockquote>

Now increase the demotion counter for the "internal" group using ifconfig(8):

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ifconfig -g internal</b>
internal: carp demote count 0
# <b>ifconfig -g internal carpdemote 50</b>
# <b>ifconfig -g internal</b>
internal: carp demote count 50
</pre></blockquote>

The firewall will now gracefully failover on the carp1 and carp2 groups
to the other firewall in the cluster while still remaining the master on
carp3 and carp4.
If the other firewall started advertising itself with a demotion value
higher than 50, or if the other firewall stopped advertising altogether,
then this firewall would again take over mastership on carp1 and carp2.

<p>
To fail back to the primary firewall, reverse the changes:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>ifconfig -g internal -carpdemote 50</b>
# <b>ifconfig -g internal</b>
internal: carp demote count 0
</pre></blockquote>

Network daemons such as <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/bgpd">OpenBGPD</a>
and <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sasyncd">sasyncd(8)</a> make use of the
demotion counter to ensure that the firewall does not become master until BGP
sessions become established and IPsec SAs are synchronized.

<h3 id="RulesetTips">Ruleset tips</h3>

<b>Filter the physical interface.</b>
As far as PF is concerned, network traffic comes from the physical
interface, not the CARP virtual interface (i.e., <tt>carp0</tt>).
So, write your rule sets accordingly.
Don't forget that an interface name in a PF rule can be either the name of
a physical interface or an address associated with that interface.
For example, this rule could be correct:

<blockquote><pre>
pass in on fxp0 inet proto tcp from any to carp0 port 22
</pre></blockquote>

But replacing the <tt>fxp0</tt> with <tt>carp0</tt> would not work as
you desire.

<p>
<b>DON'T forget</b> to pass <tt>proto carp</tt> and <tt>proto pfsync</tt>!
