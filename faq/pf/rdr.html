<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

When you have NAT running in your office, you have the entire internet
available to all your machines.
What if you have a machine behind the NAT gateway that needs to be accessed
from outside?
This is where redirection comes in.
Redirection allows incoming traffic to be sent to a machine behind the NAT
gateway.

<p>
Let's look at an example:

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in on egress proto tcp from any to any port 80 rdr-to 192.168.1.20
</pre>

This line redirects TCP port 80 (web server) traffic to a machine inside
the network at 192.168.1.20.
So, even though 192.168.1.20 is behind your gateway and inside your network,
the outside world can access it.

<p>
The <tt>from any to any</tt> part of the above <tt>rdr</tt> line can be quite
useful.
If you know what addresses or subnets are supposed to have access to the web
server at port 80, you can restrict them here:

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in on egress proto tcp from 203.0.113.0/24 to any port 80 rdr-to 192.168.1.20
</pre>

This will redirect only the specified subnet.
Note this implies you can redirect different incoming hosts to different
machines behind the gateway.
This can be quite useful as well.
For example, you could have users at remote sites access their own desktop
computers using the same port and IP address on the gateway as long as you
know the IP address they will be connecting from.

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in on egress proto tcp from 203.0.113.14 to any port 80 rdr-to 192.168.1.20
pass in on egress proto tcp from 198.51.100.89 to any port 80 rdr-to 192.168.1.22
pass in on egress proto tcp from 198.51.100.178 to any port 80 rdr-to 192.168.1.23
</pre>

A range of ports can also be redirected within the same rule:

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in on egress proto tcp from any to any port 5000:5500 \
   rdr-to 192.168.1.20
pass in on egress proto tcp from any to any port 5000:5500 \
   rdr-to 192.168.1.20 port 6000
pass in on egress proto tcp from any to any port 5000:5500 \
   rdr-to 192.168.1.20 port 7000:*
</pre>

These examples show ports 5000 to 5500 inclusive being redirected to
192.168.1.20.
In rule #1, port 5000 is redirected to 5000, 5001 to 5001, etc.
In rule #2, the entire port range is redirected to port 6000.
And in rule #3, port 5000 is redirected to 7000, 5001 to 7001, etc.

<h2 id="security">Security Implications</h2>

Redirection does have security implications.
Punching a hole in the firewall to allow traffic into the internal, protected
network potentially opens up the internal machine to compromise.
If traffic is forwarded to an internal web server and a vulnerability is
discovered in the web server daemon, that machine can be compromised from
an intruder on the internet.
From there, the intruder has a doorway to the internal network, one that is
permitted to pass right through the firewall.

<p>
These risks can be minimized by keeping the externally accessed system
tightly confined on a separate network.
This network is often referred to as a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) or a Private
Service Network (PSN).
This way, if the web server is compromised, the effects can be limited to
the DMZ/PSN network by careful filtering of the traffic permitted to and
from the DMZ/PSN.

<h2 id="reflect">Redirection and Reflection</h2>

Often, redirection rules are used to forward incoming connections from
the internet to a local server with a private address in the internal
network or LAN, as in:

<pre class="cmdbox">
server = 192.168.1.40
pass in on egress proto tcp from any to egress port 80 rdr-to $server port 80
</pre>

But when the redirection rule is tested from a client on the LAN, it doesn't
work.
The reason is that redirection rules apply only to packets that pass through
the specified interface (egress, the external interface, in the example).
Connecting to the external address of the firewall from a host on the LAN,
however, does not mean the packets will actually pass through its external
interface.
The TCP/IP stack on the firewall compares the destination address of incoming
packets with its own addresses and aliases and detects connections to itself
as soon as they have passed the internal interface.
Such packets do not physically pass through the external interface, and the
stack does not simulate such a passage in any way.
Thus, PF never sees these packets on the external interface, and the
redirection rule, specifying the external interface, does not apply.

<p>
Adding a second redirection rule for the internal interface does not have
the desired effect either.
When the local client connects to the external address of the firewall,
the initial packet of the TCP handshake reaches the firewall through the
internal interface.
The redirection rule does apply and the destination address gets replaced
with that of the internal server.
The packet gets forwarded back through the internal interface and reaches
the internal server.
But the source address has not been translated, and still contains the local
client's address, so the server sends its replies directly to the client.
The firewall never sees the reply and has no chance to properly reverse the
translation.
The client receives a reply from a source it never expected and drops it.
The TCP handshake then fails and no connection can be established.

<p>
Still, it's often desirable for clients on the LAN to connect to the
same internal server as external clients and to do so transparently.
There are several solutions for this problem:

<h3 id="splitdns">Split-horizon DNS</h3>

It's possible to configure DNS servers to answer queries from local
hosts differently than external queries so that local clients will
receive the internal server's address during name resolution.
They will then connect directly to the local server, and the firewall
isn't involved at all.
This reduces local traffic since packets don't have to be sent through
the firewall.

<h3 id="sepnet">Moving the Server into a Separate Local Network</h3>

Adding an additional network interface to the firewall and moving the
local server from the client's network into a dedicated network (DMZ)
allows redirecting of connections from local clients in the same way as
the redirection of external connections.
Use of separate networks has several advantages, including improving security
by isolating the server from the remaining local hosts.
Should the server (which in our case is reachable from the Internet) ever
become compromised, it can't access other local hosts directly as all
connections have to pass through the firewall.

<h3 id="tcpproxy">TCP Proxying</h3>

A generic TCP proxy can be setup on the firewall, either listening on
the port to be forwarded or getting connections on the internal interface
redirected to the port it's listening on.
When a local client connects to the firewall, the proxy accepts the connection,
establishes a second connection to the internal server, and forwards data
between those two connections.

<h3 id="rdrnat">RDR-TO and NAT-TO Combination</h3>

With an additional NAT rule on the internal interface, the lacking
source address translation described above can be achieved.

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in on $int_if proto tcp from $int_net to egress port 80 rdr-to $server
pass out on $int_if proto tcp to $server port 80 received-on $int_if nat-to $int_if
</pre>

This will cause the initial packet from the client to be translated
again when it's forwarded back through the internal interface, replacing
the client's source address with the firewall's internal address.
The internal server will reply back to the firewall, which can reverse both
NAT and RDR translations when forwarding to the local client.
This construct is rather complex as it creates two separate states for each
reflected connection.
Care must be taken to prevent the NAT rule from applying to other traffic,
for instance connections originating from external hosts (through other
redirections) or the firewall itself.
Note that the <tt>rdr-to</tt> rule above will cause the TCP/IP stack to see
packets arriving on the internal interface with a destination address
inside the internal network.
