<h3>
"How much bandwidth can PF handle?"<br>
"How much computing power do I need to handle my Internet connection?"
</h3>

There are no easy answers to those questions.
For a simple home connection, most hardware should be more than enough.
Other applications may require a faster machine with high-end NICs.
PF is used in some very large, high-traffic applications, and the developers
are power users of PF.
Odds are it will do very well for you.

<p>
PF performance is determined by several variables:

<ul>
  <li>Number of packets per second.
      Almost the same amount of processing needs to be done on a packet with
      1500 byte payload as for a packet with a one byte payload.
      The number of packets per second determines the number of times the state
      table and filter rules have to be evaluated every second, determining
      the effective demand on the system.
  <li>Efficiency of your network card.
      Some network adapters are just more efficient than others.
      Older <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rl">rl(4)</a> NICs tend to be
      relatively poor performers, while
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ix">ix(4)</a> NICs tend to perform
      very well.
  <li>Complexity and design of your ruleset.
      More lines being evaluated for each packet will result in slower
      performance.
      More packets being filtered by <tt>quick</tt> rules will result in
      better performance.
  <li>Barely worth mentioning: CPU and RAM.
      As PF is a kernel-based process, it will not use swap space.
      So, if you have enough RAM, it runs, if not, it panics due to
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pool">pool(9)</a> exhaustion.
      Huge amounts of RAM are not needed.
</ul>

<!-- XXXrelease change this soon... -->
<h3>Will multiple processors help?</h3>

PF will only use one processor, so multiple processors (or multiple cores)
WILL NOT improve PF performance.
However, under some circumstances, running the SMP version of OpenBSD
(<tt>bsd.mp</tt>) instead of <tt>bsd</tt> will give better performance
due to differences in how interrupt handling is done.
If you are seeing performance problems, experiment with this.
Most users will never hit any limits to worry about it.
