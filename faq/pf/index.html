Packet Filter (from here on referred to as PF) is OpenBSD's system for
filtering TCP/IP traffic and doing Network Address Translation.
PF is also capable of normalizing and conditioning TCP/IP traffic, as well
as providing bandwidth control and packet prioritization.
PF has been a part of the GENERIC kernel since OpenBSD 3.0.

<p>
PF was originally developed by Daniel Hartmeier and is now maintained and
developed by the entire OpenBSD team.

<p>
This set of documents is intended as a general introduction to the PF system
as used in OpenBSD.
Even if it covers all of PF's major features, it is only intended to be used
as a supplement to the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org">man pages</a>, not as
a replacement for them.

<p>
For a complete and in-depth view of what PF can do, please start by reading
the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf">pf(4)</a> man page.

<p>
As with the rest of the FAQ, this set of documents is focused on users of
the most current release of OpenBSD.
As PF is always growing and developing, there are changes and enhancements
between the -release version and the version in
<a href="../../plus.html">OpenBSD -current</a>.
There are also differences between the current version and earlier versions.
The reader is advised to see the man pages for the version of OpenBSD they
are currently working with.
