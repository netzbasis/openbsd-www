<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

When a packet is logged by PF, a copy of the packet header is sent to a
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pflog">pflog(4)</a> interface along with
some additional data such as the interface the packet was transiting, the
action that PF took (pass or block), etc.
The pflog(4) interface allows user-space applications to receive PF's
logging data from the kernel.
If PF is enabled when the system is booted, the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pflogd">pflogd(8)</a> daemon is started.
By default, pflogd(8) listens on the <tt>pflog0</tt> interface and writes
all logged data to the <tt>/var/log/pflog</tt> file.

<h2 id="log">Logging packets</h2>

In order to log packets passing through PF, the <tt>log</tt> keyword must
be used.
The <tt>log</tt> keyword causes all packets that match the rule to be logged.
In the case where the rule is <a href="filter.html#state">creating state</a>,
only the first packet seen (the one that causes the state to be created) will
be logged.

<p>
The options that can be given to the <tt>log</tt> keyword are:

<dl>
<dt><tt>all</tt>
<dd>Causes all matching packets, not just the initial packet, to be logged.
    Useful for rules that create state.

<dt><tt>to <i>pflogN</i></tt>
<dd>Causes all matching packets to be logged to the specified pflog(4)
    interface.
    For example, when using
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/spamlogd">spamlogd(8)</a>, all SMTP traffic
    can be logged to a dedicated pflog(4) interface by PF.
    The spamlogd(8) daemon can then be told to listen on that interface.
    This keeps the main PF logfile clean of SMTP traffic which otherwise
    would not need to be logged.
    Use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a> to create
    pflog(4) interfaces.
    The default log interface <tt>pflog0</tt> is created automatically.

<dt><tt>user</tt>
<dd>Causes the user id and group id that owns the socket that the packet is
    sourced from/destined to (whichever socket is local) to be logged along
    with the standard log information.
</dl>

<p>
Options are given in parenthesis after the <tt>log</tt> keyword; multiple
options can be separated by a comma or space.

<blockquote><pre>
pass in log (all, to pflog1) on $ext_if inet proto tcp to $ext_if port 22 keep state
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="logfile">Reading a log file</h2>

The log file written by pflogd is in binary format and cannot be read using
a text editor.
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump">tcpdump(8)</a> must be used instead.

<p>
To view the log file:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>tcpdump -n -e -ttt -r /var/log/pflog</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Note that using tcpdump(8) to watch the pflog file does <i>not</i> give
a real-time display.
A real-time display of logged packets is achieved by using the <tt>pflog0</tt>
interface:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<b>NOTE:</b> When examining the logs, special care should be taken with
tcpdump's verbose protocol decoding (activated via the <tt>-v</tt> command
line option).
tcpdump's protocol decoders do not have a perfect security history.
At least in theory, a delayed attack could be possible via the partial packet
payloads recorded by the logging device.
It is recommended practice to move the log files off of the firewall machine
before examining them in this way.

<p>
Additional care should also be taken to secure access to the logs.
By default, pflogd will record 160 bytes of the packet in the log file.
Access to the logs could provide partial access to sensitive packet payloads.

<h2 id="filter">Filtering log output</h2>

Because pflogd logs in tcpdump binary format, the full range of tcpdump
features can be used when reviewing the logs.
For example, to only see packets that match a certain port:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>tcpdump -n -e -ttt -r /var/log/pflog port 80</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This can be further refined by limiting the display of packets to a certain
host and port combination:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>tcpdump -n -e -ttt -r /var/log/pflog port 80 and host 192.168.1.3</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The same idea can be applied when reading from the <tt>pflog0</tt> interface:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0 host 192.168.4.2</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Note that this has no impact on which packets are logged to the pflogd
log file; the above commands only display packets as they are being logged.

<p>
In addition to using the standard
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump.8">tcpdump(8)</a> filter rules, the
tcpdump filter language has been extended for reading pflogd output:

<ul>
  <li><tt>ip</tt> - address family is IPv4.
  <li><tt>ip6</tt> - address family is IPv6.
  <li><tt>on <i>int</i></tt> - packet passed through the interface
      <i>int</i>.
  <li><tt>ifname <i>int</i></tt> - same as <tt>on <i>int</i></tt>.
  <li><tt>ruleset <i>name</i></tt> - the
      <a href="anchors.html">ruleset/anchor</a> that the packet was matched in.
  <li><tt>rulenum <i>num</i></tt> - the filter rule that the packet matched
      was rule number <i>num</i>.
  <li><tt>action <i>act</i></tt> - the action taken on the packet.
      Possible actions are <tt>pass</tt> and <tt>block</tt>.
  <li><tt>reason <i>res</i></tt> - the reason that <tt>action</tt> was taken.
      Possible reasons are <tt>match</tt>, <tt>bad-offset</tt>,
      <tt>fragment</tt>, <tt>short</tt>, <tt>normalize</tt>,
      <tt>memory</tt>, <tt>bad-timestamp</tt>, <tt>congestion</tt>,
      <tt>ip-option</tt>, <tt>proto-cksum</tt>, <tt>state-mismatch</tt>,
      <tt>state-insert</tt>, <tt>state-limit</tt>, <tt>src-limit</tt>
      and <tt>synproxy</tt>.
  <li><tt>inbound</tt> - packet was inbound.
  <li><tt>outbound</tt> - packet was outbound.
</ul>

<p>
Example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0 inbound and action block and on wi0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This display the log, in real-time, of inbound packets that were blocked
on the wi0 interface.

<h2 id="syslog">Packet logging through syslog</h2>

In many situations it is desirable to have the firewall logs available
in ASCII format and/or to send them to a remote logging server.
All this can be accomplished with a small shell script, some minor changes
of the OpenBSD configuration files, and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/syslogd">syslogd(8)</a>, the logging daemon.
syslogd logs in ASCII and is also able to log to a remote logging server.

<p>
Create the following script as <tt>/etc/pflogrotate</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
#!/bin/sh
PFLOG=/var/log/pflog
FILE=/var/log/pflog5min.$(date "+%Y%m%d%H%M")

pkill -ALRM -u root -U root -t - -x pflogd
if [ -r $PFLOG ] && [ $(stat -f %z $PFLOG) -gt 24 ]; then
   mv $PFLOG $FILE
   pkill -HUP -u root -U root -t - -x pflogd
   tcpdump -n -e -s 160 -ttt -r $FILE | logger -t pf -p local0.info
   rm $FILE
fi
</pre></blockquote>

Edit root's cron table:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>crontab -u root -e</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Add the following two lines:

<blockquote><pre>
# rotate pf log file every 5 minutes
0-59/5 *       *       *       *       /bin/sh /etc/pflogrotate
</pre></blockquote>

Add the following line to <tt>/etc/syslog.conf</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
local0.info     /var/log/pflog.txt
</pre></blockquote>

If you also want to log to a remote log server, add the line:

<blockquote><pre>
local0.info     @syslogger
</pre></blockquote>

Make sure host <i>syslogger</i> has been defined in the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/hosts">hosts(5)</a> file.

<p>
Create the file <tt>/var/log/pflog.txt</tt> to allow syslog to log to
that file, and give it the same permissions as the pflog file.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>touch /var/log/pflog.txt</b>
# <b>chmod 600 /var/log/pflog.txt</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Make syslogd notice the changes by restarting it:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/syslog.pid)</b>
</pre></blockquote>

All logged packets are now sent to <tt>/var/log/pflog.txt</tt>.
If the second line is added, they are sent to the remote logging host
<i>syslogger</i> as well.

<p>
The script <tt>/etc/pflogrotate</tt> now processes and then deletes
<tt>/var/log/pflog</tt> so rotation of <tt>pflog</tt> by
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/newsyslog">newsyslog(8)</a> is no longer
necessary and should be disabled.
However, <tt>/var/log/pflog.txt</tt> replaces <tt>/var/log/pflog</tt> and
rotation of it should be activated.
Change <tt>/etc/newsyslog.conf</tt> as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
#/var/log/pflog       600    3    250    *    ZB "pkill -HUP -u root -U root -t - -x pflogd"
/var/log/pflog.txt    600    7    *      24
</pre></blockquote>

PF will now log in ASCII to <tt>/var/log/pflog.txt</tt>.
If so configured in <tt>/etc/syslog.conf</tt>, it will also log to a remote
server.
The logging is not immediate but it can take up to about 5-6 minutes (the cron
job interval) before the logged packets appear in the file.
