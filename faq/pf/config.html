<h2 id="activate">Activation</h2>

PF is enabled by default.
If you wish to disable it on boot, use the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rcctl">rcctl(8)</a> tool to do so:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl disable pf</b>
</pre>

Reboot your system to have it take effect.

<p>
You can also manually activate and deactivate PF by using the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a> program:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>pfctl -e</b>
# <b>pfctl -d</b>
</pre>

These would enable and disable PF.
Note that it doesn't actually load a ruleset, however.
The ruleset must be loaded separately, either before or after PF is enabled.

<h2 id="config">Configuration</h2>

PF reads its configuration rules from
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a> at boot time, as
loaded by the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc">rc scripts</a>.
Note that while <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>
is the default and is loaded by the system rc scripts, it is just a text file
loaded and interpreted by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a>
and inserted into <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf">pf(4)</a>.
For some applications, other rulesets may be loaded from other files after boot.

<p>
The <code>pf.conf</code> file has multiple parts:

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="macros.html">Macros:</a></b> User-defined variables that
  can hold IP addresses, interface names, etc.
  <li><b><a href="tables.html">Tables:</a></b> A structure used to hold lists
  of IP addresses.
  <li><b><a href="options.html">Options:</a></b> Various options to control
  how PF works.
  <li><b><a href="filter.html">Filter Rules:</a></b> Allows the selective
  filtering or blocking of packets as they pass through any of the interfaces.
  Filter rules can be given parameters to specify
  <a href="nat.html">network address translation</a> and
  <a href="rdr.html">packet redirection</a>.
</ul>

Blank lines are ignored, and lines beginning with <code>#</code> are treated
as comments.

<h2 id="control">Control</h2>

After boot, PF operation can be managed using the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a> program.
Some example commands are:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>pfctl -f  /etc/pf.conf</b>	Load the pf.conf file
# <b>pfctl -nf /etc/pf.conf</b>	Parse the file, but don't load it
# <b>pfctl -sr</b>			Show the current ruleset
# <b>pfctl -ss</b>			Show the current state table
# <b>pfctl -si</b>			Show filter stats and counters
# <b>pfctl -sa</b>			Show EVERYTHING it can show
</pre>

For a complete list of commands, please see the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl">man page</a>.
