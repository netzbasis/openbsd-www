<h2 id="confaudio">Configuring audio devices with mixerctl</h2>

All supported audio drivers are already included in the GENERIC kernel, so
there is no need for extra configuration or installation of drivers.
Running <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mixerctl">mixerctl(1)</a> with no
arguments will list the device's mixer controls and current settings.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>mixerctl</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Some devices have only a handful of controls, some have a hundred or more.
Note that not every option of every audio chip necessarily reaches the
outside world.
There may be, for example, more outputs listed than are physically available
on a sound card or motherboard.

<p>
There are a few controls that are common to many devices:

<ul>
  <li><tt>outputs.master</tt> controls the playback output level
  <li><tt>record.source</tt> controls what inputs are mixed into the
      ADC (analog to digital converter), used when recording
  <li><tt>record.volume</tt> controls the input level of the ADC
</ul>

The controls of an audio device may be labeled differently.
Usually the controls have a meaningful label, but sometimes one must simply
try different settings to see what effect each control has.

<p>
Some devices use what is known as EAPD, which stands for external amplifier
power down.
However, this is just another on/off switch.
It is probably referred to as "power down" because it is often used for
power saving, which means this type of control is more often found in laptops.
Sometimes it is necessary to set controls with <tt>eapd</tt> or
<tt>extamp</tt> in their name to <tt>on</tt> to get an output signal.

<p>
As a basic example of common <tt>mixerctl</tt> usage, to set the volume
of the left and right channels to 200, you would issue

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>mixerctl outputs.master=200,200</b>
outputs.master: 255,255 -> 207,207
</pre></blockquote>

Notice how the value becomes 207.
The reason for this is that this audio device uses
only 5 bits for volume control, leading to only 32 possible values.
Other hardware could have different resolution.

<p>
To unmute the master channel, you would do:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>mixerctl outputs.master.mute=off</b>
outputs.master.mute: on -> off
</pre></blockquote>

To make the changes take effect on each reboot, edit
<tt>/etc/mixerctl.conf</tt>.
For example:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cat /etc/mixerctl.conf</b>
outputs.master=200,200
outputs.master.mute=off
outputs.headphones=160,160
outputs.headphones.mute=off
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="playaudio">Playing different kinds of audio</h2>

OpenBSD comes with <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/aucat">aucat(1)</a>,
a program for recording and playing WAV, AIFF and AU files.
The following example will play a WAV file.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>aucat -i filename.wav</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Other audio formats are handled by audio ports.

<h2 id="playCD">Playing audio CDs</h2>

It is possible to play audio CDs by either having the CD drive play
the disc and send analog audio to the sound card, or by reading the
audio data and sending the digital samples to the sound card over
the PCI bus.

<p>
To play an audio CD using the analog output of your CD-ROM drive, you can

<ul>
  <li>Use the headphones output, usually at the front side of the drive.
  <li>Connect the audio output at the back side of the drive to your audio card.
</ul>

Use the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cdio">cdio(1)</a> utility to play a CD:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cdio play</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will play from the first CD-ROM drive, <tt>cd0</tt>, by default.
Note that the user running cdio should have permissions to read the CD-ROM
device (e.g. <tt>/dev/rcd0c</tt>).
As this device is only readable by root or the operator group by default,
you may want to add the user to the <tt>operator</tt> group for convenience
by adjusting this group's line in <tt>/etc/group</tt>.
Alternatively, you can modify the file permissions of the device as needed.

<p>
Note that you may need to unmute the CD input of the mixer.
Just like the outputs, the actual name of this input may vary between
systems, but you will be using a command like:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>mixerctl inputs.cd.mute=off</b>
</pre></blockquote>

It is also possible that there is no analog audio connection between
your CD drive and audio device.
In this case, you could use <tt>cdio</tt>'s <tt>cdplay</tt> command
to send the CD audio data to the sound card through the PCI bus.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cdio cdplay</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Many GUI CD players are in the <tt>audio</tt> section of packages and ports.

<h2 id="recordaudio">Recording audio samples</h2>

<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/aucat">aucat(1)</a> comes with OpenBSD and
can be used for recording.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>aucat -o file.wav</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The above command will start the recording of a file in WAV format.
Press [CTRL]-C to finish the recording.
The file will contain signed 16-bit stereo samples at 48kHz.
Other sample formats, sample rates and number of channels can be also be
recorded.
See the manual for details.

<p>
To use aucat to play the file back, run:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>aucat -i file.wav</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If recording seemed to work, but playback of the recording was silent or
not what was expected, the mixer probably needs some configuration.
Make sure that you select the right device to record from and that the
source is unmuted.
You can set the necessary parameters using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mixerctl">mixerctl(1)</a>.
For example:

<blockquote><pre>
inputs.mic.mute=off
inputs.mic.preamp=on
inputs.mic.source=mic0
record.source=mic
record.volume=255,255
record.volume.mute=off
record.mic=255
record.mic.mute=off
</pre></blockquote>

These are settings for recording from a microphone.
Pre-amplifying has been enabled, otherwise the recorded sound can be pretty
silent on some systems.
However, pre-amplifying can also be quite loud on other systems.

<h2 id="recordmon">Recording a monitor mix of all audio playback</h2>

A monitoring stream records combined audio output from all playback devices,
allowing you to duplicate or save anything going through the audio subsystem.
This feature can be useful for screencasts or any kind of live audio mixing.

<p>
Create the monitor sub-device <tt>mon</tt> for
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sndiod">sndiod(8)</a> by using:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl set sndiod flags -s default -m play,mon -s mon</b>
# <b>rcctl restart sndiod</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Configure your program to record audio from the <tt>snd/0.mon</tt> device:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>aucat -f snd/0.mon -o file.wav</b>
</pre></blockquote>

At this point, whatever your system plays is recorded in <tt>file.wav</tt>.

<h2 id="audioserver">OpenBSD's audio server, sndiod</h2>

<!-- This section Copyright (c) 2009 Alexandre Ratchov -->

<h3>What latency do I need?</h3>

The latency is the time between when a program takes the decision to play
a sample and when the user hears the sample.
Since audio data is always buffered, this delay is proportional to
the audio buffer size.
The following values are recommended:

<ul>
  <li>Real-time synthesizers: 5ms.
      This is the time it takes between hitting a key on your MIDI keyboard
      and actually hearing the note.
      Roughly, 5ms corresponds to the time it takes for the sound to
      propagate 1.75m.
  <li>Games: 50ms.
      This is the time between when you see an event and you hear the
      corresponding sound.
  <li>Movie players and alike: 500ms and more.
      Such applications "know" the sound to play in advance, and send audio
      data in such a way that it is played simultaneously with the
      corresponding picture.
</ul>

The smaller audio buffers are (to achieve low latency), the larger the
probability to overrun/underrun is.
Buffer overruns/underruns result in stuttering of the sound.

<p>
sndiod(8) imposes a minimum latency on all audio applications,
and the default latency is 160ms.

If you plan to use applications that require a lower latency, use the
<tt>-b</tt> option to select the desired latency (expressed in number of
frames).
For instance, at 48000 samples/second, 50ms latency corresponds to:

<blockquote>
48000 samples/second x 0.050 seconds = 2400 samples
</blockquote>

Then do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl set sndiod flags -b2400</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Does low latency improve audio-video synchronization?</h3>

No, synchronizing audio to video doesn't require low latency.
Synchronization problems are often caused by the software itself.
Forcing the application to use smaller buffers (by starting sndiod(8)
in low latency mode) may hide the actual problem in some cases, and
give the feeling that the software works better, but obviously the
right thing to do is to start searching for the corresponding bug.

<h3>How do I use a remote sound card?</h3>

sndiod(8) can be configured to accept connections from the network,
allowing other machines to use the sound card as well.
On the remote system, the one with the sound card, run:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl set sndiod flags -L-</b>
</pre></blockquote>

On the local system, configure your program to use:

<blockquote><pre>
snd@hostname/0
</pre></blockquote>

where "hostname" is the address of the remote system.
The <tt>AUDIODEVICE</tt> environment variable could be set to the above value
to make the remote sound card the default audio device.

<p>
Any system able to connect to TCP port 11025 of the remote host will be able
to use the audio device.
For privacy reasons, only one user from one system may have connections
to it at a given time.
If multiple systems have to use the audio device simultaneously, the
sndio(7) authorization cookie must be the same.
For instance, copy your <tt>~/.aucat_cookie</tt> to all accounts
that may use the audio device.

<p>
To avoid glitches, TCP traffic on port 11025 could be prioritized with
the packet filter.
With the default configuration, sndiod will consume around 200kB/s of
network bandwidth.

<h2 id="audioprob">Debugging audio problems</h2>

If you do not hear anything when playing audio, it's possible there
is a mixer control turned to low or simply muted.
See <a href="#confaudio">this section</a> for configuring the mixer.
Please unmute <b>all</b> inputs and outputs before reporting a problem.

<p>
If you believe your device should be working, but for whatever reason isn't,
then it's time for a little debugging.
The following steps can determine if data is being processed by the DAC.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cat > /dev/audio < /dev/zero &amp;</b>
[1] 9926
$ <b>audioctl play.{bytes,errors}</b>
play.bytes=3312000
play.errors=0
$ <b>audioctl play.{bytes,errors}</b>
play.bytes=7065600
play.errors=0
$ <b>audioctl play.{bytes,errors}</b>
play.bytes=9379200
play.errors=0
$ <b>kill %1</b>
$ <b>fg %1</b>
cat > /dev/audio < /dev/zero
Terminated
</pre></blockquote>

Here we see that the processed data count <tt>play.samples</tt> increases
each time we check, so data is flowing.
We also see that the device has not underrun any samples (<tt>play.errors</tt>).
That's good too.

<p>
Note that even if you had speakers plugged in when running the above
test, you should not have heard anything.
The test sends zeros to the device, which is silence for all currently
supported default encodings.

<p>
Since we know the device can process data, it's a good idea to check the mixer
settings again.
Make sure all outputs and all inputs are unmuted and are at a reasonable level.

<p>
If you are still having problems at this point, it's probably time to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/report.html">file a bug report</a>.
Besides the normal bug report information such as a full dmesg and description
of the problem, please also include the default output of <tt>mixerctl -v</tt>
and the output of the above test for DAC processing.

<h2 id="midi">Using MIDI instruments</h2>

The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) protocol provides a
standardized and efficient means to represent musical performance information
as electronic data.
MIDI data contains only instructions needed by a synthesizer to play the
sounds, rather than the actual sounds.

<p>
To play MIDI data, a synthesizer connected to a MIDI port of the machine is
required.
Similarly, to record a MIDI data a MIDI instrument is required (such as a MIDI
keyboard).
Certain sound cards contain embedded MIDI synthesizers that are attached as
MIDI ports.
Advanced MIDI instruments may contain multiple subparts (synthesizers,
keyboards, control surfaces, etc...), they appear as multiple MIDI ports
on OpenBSD.

<p>
When you already have OpenBSD running, look for MIDI ports in the output of
the dmesg(8) command.
An example of MIDI ports in a dmesg output is:

<blockquote><pre>
umidi0 at uhub2 port 2 configuration 1 interface 0 "Roland Roland XV-2020" rev 1.10/1.00 addr 2
midi0 at umidi0: &lt;USB MIDI I/F&gt;
umidi1 at uhub1 port 2 configuration 1 interface 1 "Evolution Electronics Ltd. USB Keystation 61es" rev 1.00/1.25 addr 3
midi1 at umidi1: &lt;USB MIDI I/F&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

It shows three MIDI ports, known by
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sndio">sndio(7)</a> as:

<ul>
  <li><tt>rmidi/0</tt> - synthesizer connected via USB
  <li><tt>rmidi/1</tt> - a MIDI master keyboard
</ul>

They are backed by the <tt>/dev/rmidi0</tt> and <tt>/dev/rmidi1</tt>
character devices.
The latter devices are handy for testing the hardware, bypassing most
software layers.

To test your MIDI keyboard, you can use the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/hexdump">hexdump(1)</a> utility to display
MIDI data you're playing on it:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>hexdump -e '1/1 "%02x\n"' &lt; /dev/rmidi0</b>
90
3c
71
...
</pre></blockquote>

The output of the keyboard can be connected to the input of the synthesizer,
as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cat -u &lt; /dev/rmidi0 &gt; /dev/rmidi1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Now you can hear on the synthesizer what you're playing on the MIDI keyboard.

<p>
The main utility to play standard MIDI files is
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/midiplay">midiplay(1)</a>.
Playing a standard MIDI file, in this example through the synthesizer is as
easy as:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>midiplay -f rmidi/0 file.mid</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sndiod">sndiod(8)</a> server exposes MIDI
thru ports, allowing programs to send each other MIDI data.
For instance, if you have no hardware synthesizer connected, you could
start a software one (like the audio/fluidsynth port) and then use it as MIDI
output:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>midiplay -f midithru/0 file.mid</b>
</pre></blockquote>

To record MIDI files, you can use the <tt>smfrec</tt> utility bundled in
the <tt>audio/midish</tt> port.
For instance:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>smfrec -d rmidi/0 -i rmidi/1 file.mid</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will record what is played on the keyboard (<tt>rmidi/1</tt>) while
sending it in real-time on the synthesizer (<tt>rmidi/0</tt>) so you can hear
what you're playing.
More complicated operations like editing, routing, mixing and transforming
MIDI data can be achieved using the <tt>rmidish</tt> utility bundled in the
<tt>audio/midish</tt> port.

<h2 id="playDVD">Playing DVDs</h2>

OpenBSD supports DVD media through the ISO 9660 filesystem, which is also used
on CD-ROMs, and also through the
<a href="http://www.osta.org/specs/">Universal Disk Format (UDF)</a> filesystem
which is found on some DVDs.
However, almost all DVD-Video and DVD-ROM discs use the UDF bridge format,
which is a combination of the DVD MicroUDF (subset of UDF 1.02) and ISO 9660
filesystems.
It is used for backward compatibility reasons.

<p>
Some popular media players, supporting DVD playback, have been ported to
OpenBSD.
Some popular examples are <a href="https://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a>
and <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a>.
Please read the installation instructions that come with these packages,
because these tools may need further setup.
With these utilities, it is possible to play the DVDs by directly accessing
the raw device.
Of course, it is also possible to mount a DVD using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount_cd9660">mount_cd9660(8)</a> and play
the files directly.

<p>
<b>Notes:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Nearly all DVDs you buy are encrypted using the Content Scrambling
      System (CSS).
      To be able to play these encrypted DVDs, you can use the <b>libdvd</b>
      library, also available through packages and ports.
  <li>Be aware that a region code may be present on your DVD disk(s).
      This should not be much of a problem when playing DVDs on a computer.
</ul>

<h2 id="burnCD">Burning CDs and DVDs</h2>

<h3 id="burnIntro">Introduction and basic setup</h3>

You should first make sure your CD/DVD writer has been recognized and
configured by the kernel.
Most SCSI devices are supported.
SATA, IDE/ATAPI and USB devices are supported through SCSI emulation.
You can quickly find your device in the output of
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dmesg">dmesg(8)</a>.
Just look for lines beginning with "cd."
For example:

<blockquote><pre>
cd0 at scsibus0 targ 0 lun 0: &lt;TOSHIBA, CD-ROM XM-5702B, 2826&gt; SCSI0 5/cdrom removable
cd1 at scsibus1 targ 4 lun 0: &lt;PLEXTOR, CD-R PX-R412C, 1.04&gt; SCSI2 5/cdrom removable
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Error: <tt>mount_cd9660: /dev/cd2c on /mnt/cdrom: No such file or
directory</tt></h4>

By default, the OpenBSD installer creates only two cd device nodes,
<tt>cd0</tt> and <tt>cd1</tt>.
To start using your <tt>cd2</tt> device, you must create the necessary
device nodes for it.
The recommended way to do that is using the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/MAKEDEV">MAKEDEV(8)</a> script.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /dev</b>
# <b>./MAKEDEV cd2</b>
</pre></blockquote>

In what follows, we will mostly be accessing the CD/DVD writer through the
<i>raw</i> character device, <b>not</b> the <i>block</i> device.

<h4>Checking CD/DVD writer operation</h4>

It is recommended to check whether your CD/DVD writer is working correctly.
In this example, we'll be using this USB DVD writer:

<blockquote><pre>
cd2 at scsibus2 targ 1 lun 0: &lt;LITE-ON, DVDRW LDW-851S, GS0C&gt; SCSI0 5/cdrom removable
</pre></blockquote>

Try to use it by mounting an existing CD/DVD in it.
If desired, you could also check the transfer rate you are getting when
copying files to your hard disk.

<h3 id="writeCD">Writing CDs</h3>

<h4>Creating data CD-ROMs</h4>

First, you will want to create an ISO 9660 filesystem to put on a CD-ROM.
To do this you can use the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mkhybrid">mkhybrid(8)</a>
utility in the base system, or the <tt>mkisofs</tt> utility from the
<tt>cdrtools</tt> <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">package</a>.
In the examples below, we will use <tt>mkhybrid</tt>, although <tt>mkisofs</tt>
usage is very similar.

<p>
For example, to store the OpenBSD kernel sources in an ISO9660 image, you
might do:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>mkhybrid -R -o sys.iso /usr/src/sys</b>

Using ALTQ_RMC.000;1 for  /usr/src/sys/altq/altq_rmclass_debug.h (altq_rmclass.h)
...
Using IEEE8021.00H;1 for  /usr/src/sys/net80211/ieee80211_amrr.c (ieee80211.c)
 10.89% done, estimate finish Sat Nov  3 08:01:23 2007
 21.78% done, estimate finish Sat Nov  3 08:01:28 2007
...
 87.12% done, estimate finish Sat Nov  3 08:01:31 2007
 98.01% done, estimate finish Sat Nov  3 08:01:32 2007
Total translation table size: 0
Total rockridge attributes bytes: 896209
Total directory bytes: 2586624
Path table size(bytes): 11886
Max brk space used 0
45919 extents written (89 Mb)
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>-R</tt> option tells <tt>mkhybrid</tt> to create Rock Ridge
extensions in the ISO 9660 image.
The Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol was created to support POSIX filesystem
semantics in ISO 9660 filesystems, such as longer file names, ownerships,
permissions, file links, soft links, device nodes, deep file hierarchies
(more than 8 levels of subdirectories), etc.

<p>
If you want the long file names on your CD-ROM to be readable on Windows
or DOS systems, you should add the <tt>-J</tt> flag to include Joliet
extensions in the ISO 9660 image as well.

<p>
After creating the filesystem, you can verify it by
<a href="faq14.html#MountImage">mounting the ISO 9660 image</a>.
If all is well, you are now ready to burn the CD-R(W).
The easiest way to do this is to use the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cdio">cdio(1)</a> utility.

<p>
If you are using multi-write media such as CD-RW, you will need to blank the
media before burning it.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cdio -f cd1c blank</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You are now ready to burn the image created in the above example to a blank
CD-R(W).
You could use a command similar to:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cdio -f cd1c tao sys.iso</b>
</pre></blockquote>

With the options specified above, we're asking cdio to use the second CD-ROM
device as the CD writer.

<p>
To verify whether the CD-ROM has been written correctly, you can mount it
and check whether everything is there.
To mount the filesystem, you should use the <i>block</i> device for the
CD-ROM drive, which in this case is still the CD writer:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mount /dev/cd1c /mnt/cdrom</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Creating audio CDs</h4>

To burn audio CDs, you can again use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cdio">cdio(1)</a> with the <tt>tao -a</tt>
option.

<p>
As an example, we'll be making a backup copy of a music CD.
This involves two steps:

<ol>
<li>Fetch the audio tracks from the original CD.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cdio -f cd1c cdrip</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This command will extract a series of WAV files from your second CD-ROM drive
to your disk.

<li>Write the audio tracks to a blank CD.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cdio -f cd1c tao -a *.wav</b>
</pre></blockquote>
</ol>

<h3 id="writeDVD">Writing DVDs</h3>

There are a few important things about DVD you should know about before
proceeding to write your own DVDs.

<p>
<b>Important notes:</b>

<ul>
  <li>If you really want to know all about DVDs, you can read the very
      extensive <a href="http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html">DVD FAQ</a>
      document to start with.
  <li>This section has seen only very limited testing, and we certainly have
      not tried every possible media and writer combination.
      Nevertheless, we have had, or have heard of, positive experiences with
      all of the DVD formats mentioned below.
</ul>

<h4>Different DVD formats</h4>

There are a number of different DVD formats.
Commonly used are the DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, and DVD+RW formats (R means
writable once, RW means it can be rewritten a few thousand times).
They are pretty much competing standards.

<p>
A pretty different format is DVD-RAM, which was mainly developed as a
data drive and has advanced packet writing functions, allowing it to be
used like a kind of optical hard disk.
DVD-RAM is not recommended for video usage as video gets written to the
discs in a format not compatible with normal DVD players.

<p>
The important thing is using media which suits your DVD writer.
If you expect compatibility with other DVD players, watch your step and
be sure to read
<a href="http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#4.3.1">this section</a>
of the DVD FAQ.

<h4>DVD writing speed</h4>

It may be useful to point out that DVD speed indications differ from CD-ROM
speed indications.
The following table gives an overview:

<p>
<table border="1" style="empty-cells: show;">
<tr align="center">
<td>DVD read/write speed</td>
<td>Transfer rate (MB/s)</td>
<td>Equivalent CD-R(W) read/write speed</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>1x</td>
<td>1.32</td>
<td>9x</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>2x</td>
<td>2.64</td>
<td>18x</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>4x</td>
<td>5.28</td>
<td>36x</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>8x</td>
<td>10.57</td>
<td>72x</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
As can been seen from the table, the transfer rates are relatively high,
and you should check whether your bus (SCSI, IDE/ATAPI, SATA, USB) is
performant enough to handle this throughput.
In general, the speed of SCSI, SATA, and IDE/ATAPI buses should be just fine.

<h4>Writing the DVD</h4>

Basically, the process is very similar to writing CD-R(W)s.
The software used, however, is different.
At the moment, the best option is <tt>growisofs</tt> from the
<tt>sysutils/dvd+rw-tools</tt> package.
This utility writes an ISO 9660 image to the DVD medium.
All recordable DVD formats are supported by the dvd+rw-tools.

<p>
In case you want to find out more info about the media in your DVD writer,
you can use the <tt>dvd+rw-mediainfo</tt> utility.

There are two options to write the DVD:

<ul>
  <li>Pre-master an ISO 9660 from your data, storing the image on your hard
      disk, then write this image to the DVD.
  <li>Write an ISO 9660 from your data immediately to the DVD.
</ul>

I created a pre-mastered ISO 9660 image from the OpenBSD CVS modules
(src, xenocara, ports and www) contained in the /cvs directory on my disk.
I used the following command, which looks very similar to the one I used
to create the CD-ROM image above.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>mkhybrid -r -o cvs.iso /cvs</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If desired, check the ISO 9660 filesystem by
<a href="faq14.html#MountImage">mounting the image</a>.
To write this image (about 2 GB) to an empty DVD disc, one could use:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/rcd2c=cvs.iso</b>
Executing 'builtin_dd if=cvs.iso of=/dev/rcd2c obs=32k seek=0'
/dev/rcd2c: pre-formatting blank DVD+RW...
/dev/rcd2c: "Current Write Speed" is 4.1x1385KBps.
  23822336/1545832448 ( 1.5%) @3.9x, remaining 5:19
  42172416/1545832448 ( 2.7%) @3.9x, remaining 5:20
  60522496/1545832448 ( 3.9%) @3.9x, remaining 4:54
...
1504706560/1545832448 (97.3%) @3.9x, remaining 0:07
1523318784/1545832448 (98.5%) @3.9x, remaining 0:04
1541898240/1545832448 (99.7%) @3.9x, remaining 0:00
/dev/rcd2c: flushing cache
/dev/rcd2c: writing lead-out
/dev/rcd2c: reloading tray
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>-Z</tt> option tells growisofs to burn an initial session to the
device, which in this case is my DVD writer, attached to <tt>cd2</tt>.
The <tt>-dvd-compat</tt> option closes the disk, which means no more sessions
can be appended to it.
This should provide better compatibility with video DVD players and some
older DVD-ROM units.

<p>
Notice how growisofs indicates the writing speed, in this case 3.9x
DVD speed, which is what could be expected from the media and writer
combination, as indicated by dvd+rw-mediainfo.

<p>
If you are short on disk space and cannot store an ISO 9660 image for a
DVD, you can write your data directly to the DVD.
Let's first do a dry run, which simulates the creation of the filesystem.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>growisofs -dry-run -Z /dev/rcd2c -R /cvs</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If this succeeds, just leave out the -dry-run option and start burning the
DVD.

<p>
It is also possible to append data to an existing DVD, by using the
<tt>-M</tt> option, which merges a new session to an existing one:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>growisofs -M /dev/rcd2c -R /mydata</b>
</pre></blockquote>

For more information about growisofs, refer to the man page.

<p>
When you have finished writing the DVD, mount it and check whether
everything you expected to be there is indeed there.

<h4>Why am I not getting the writing speed I expected?</h4>

Instead of the above writing output, you may see something like:

<blockquote><pre>
   4784128/1545832448 ( 0.3%) @0.7x, remaining 26:50
   7929856/1545832448 ( 0.5%) @0.7x, remaining 29:05
  14123008/1545832448 ( 0.9%) @0.7x, remaining 27:06
...
</pre></blockquote>

which is much slower.
It means you are somehow not getting enough throughput on whatever bus
your DVD writer is using.
In the above example, the USB DVD writer was attached to a machine on which
the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ehci">ehci(4)</a> driver, used by USB 2.0
controllers, failed to initialize properly.
As always, you are welcome to provide patches and test results.
The DVD writer fell back to the slower USB 1.1 interface, which causes
reduced throughput.
Indeed, USB 1.1 is limited to 12 Mbit/s, which amounts to 1.43 MB/s or 1.08x
in DVD speed terms.
The DVD writer falls back to a lower pace than the maximum to reduce the risk
of buffer underruns.
