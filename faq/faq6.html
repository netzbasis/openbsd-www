<h2 id="Setup">Network Configuration</h2>

Network configuration in OpenBSD is done with text files in <code>/etc</code>.
Typically, these settings are initially configured during the
<a href="faq4.html">installation process</a>.

<h3 id="Setup.if">Identifying and Setting Up Your Network Interfaces</h3>

Interfaces are named by the type of card, not the type of connection.
For example, here's a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dmesg">dmesg(8)</a>
snippet for an Intel Fast Ethernet network card:

<pre class="cmdbox">
fxp0 at pci0 dev 10 function 0 "Intel 82557" rev 0x0c: irq 5, address 00:02:b3:2b:10:f7
inphy0 at fxp0 phy 1: i82555 10/100 media interface, rev. 4
</pre>

This device uses the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fxp">fxp(4)</a> driver
and is assigned the number 0 here.

<p>
You can find out what network interfaces have been identified by using the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a> utility.
The following command will show all network interfaces on a system.

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>ifconfig</b>
lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 33200
        index 3 priority 0 llprio 3
        groups: lo
        inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
fxp0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
        lladdr 00:02:b3:2b:10:f7
        index 1 priority 0 llprio 3
        media: Ethernet autoselect (100baseTX full-duplex)
        status: active
        inet 10.0.0.38 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255
enc0: flags=0&lt;&gt;
        index 2 priority 0 llprio 3
        groups: enc
        status: active
pflog0: flags=141&lt;UP,RUNNING,PROMISC&gt; mtu 33200
        index 4 priority 0 llprio 3
        groups: pflog
</pre>

This sample shows only one physical Ethernet interface: <code>fxp0</code>.
An IP is configured on it, hence the values
<code>inet 10.0.0.38 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255</code>.
The <code>UP</code> and <code>RUNNING</code> flags are also set on it.

<p>
The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstart">netstart(8)</a> script configures
network interfaces at boot time using
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if">hostname.if(5)</a> files, where
"if" is replaced by the full name of each interface.
The example above would use the file <code>/etc/hostname.fxp0</code>, containing
the following options:

<pre class="cmdbox">
inet 10.0.0.38 255.255.255.0
</pre>

This <code>hostname.fxp0</code> file also has an interactive equivalent:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>ifconfig fxp0 10.0.0.38 255.255.255.0</b>
</pre>

Finally, you will notice several other interfaces come enabled by default.
These are virtual interfaces that serve various functions.
The following manual pages describe them:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/enc">enc</a>
    - Encapsulating interface
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lo">lo</a>
    - Loopback interface
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pflog">pflog</a>
    - Packet Filter logging interface
</ul>

Other virtual interfaces can be added with
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a>'s <code>create</code>
subcommand.

<h3 id="Setup.gateway">Default Hostname and Gateway</h3>

The <code>/etc/myname</code> and <code>/etc/mygate</code> files are read by the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstart">netstart(8)</a> script.
Both of these files consist of a single line, specifying the fully qualified
domain name of the system and the address of the gateway host, respectively.
The <code>/etc/mygate</code> file need not exist on all systems.
See <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/myname">myname(5)</a> for more details.

<h3 id="Setup.resolver">DNS Resolution</h3>

DNS resolution is controlled by
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolv.conf">resolv.conf(5)</a>.

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>cat /etc/resolv.conf</b>
search example.com
nameserver 125.2.3.4
nameserver 125.2.3.5
lookup file bind
</pre>

Here, the default domain name will be <code>example.com</code>,
there will be two DNS resolvers,
<code>125.2.3.4</code> and <code>125.2.3.5</code>, and the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hosts">hosts(5)</a> file will be consulted
before the DNS resolvers are.

<h3 id="Setup.activate">Activating the Changes</h3>

From here, you can either reboot or run the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstart">netstart(8)</a> script:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>sh /etc/netstart</b>
</pre>

Note that a few warnings may be produced when running this script if you are
reconfiguring interfaces that have already been configured.
Use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a> to make sure that
your interfaces were set up correctly.

<p>
Even though you can completely reconfigure networking on a running OpenBSD
system, a reboot is recommended after any significant reconfiguration.

<h3 id="Setup.chkroute">Checking Routes</h3>

You can check your routes via
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstat">netstat(1)</a> or
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/route">route(8)</a>.

<pre class="cmdbox">

</pre>

<h3 id="Setup.aliases">Setting Up Aliases on an Interface</h3>

To set up an IP alias on an interface, simply edit its
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if">hostname.if(5)</a> file.

<p>
Suppose you have a <code>dc0</code> interface.
You are on the network <code>192.168.0.0</code>,
the IP address for <code>dc0</code> is
<code>192.168.0.2</code> and the netmask is <code>255.255.255.0</code>.

<p>
Assuming you are using multiple IP addresses which are in the same subnet
with aliases, your netmask setting for each alias becomes
<code>255.255.255.255</code>.
They do not need to follow the netmask of the first IP bound to the interface.
In this example,
two aliases are added to the interface <code>dc0</code>, which was configured as
<code>192.168.0.2</code> with a netmask of <code>255.255.255.0</code>.

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>cat /etc/hostname.dc0</b>
inet 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0
inet alias 192.168.0.3 255.255.255.255
inet alias 192.168.0.4 255.255.255.255
</pre>

Once you've created this file, <a href="#Setup.activate">run netstart</a> or
reboot.
To view all aliases, use <code>ifconfig -A</code>.

<h2 id="DHCP">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h2>

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a way to configure network
interfaces automatically.
OpenBSD can be a DHCP server that configures other machines, or a DHCP client
that is configured by a DHCP server.

<h3 id="DHCPclient">DHCP Client</h3>

To use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient">dhclient(8)</a>, edit the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if">hostname.if(5)</a> file of your
interface.
The <a href="#Wireless">wireless networking</a> section explains how to
set up wireless interfaces.
For ethernet interfaces, one line is enough:

<pre class="cmdbox">
dhcp
</pre>

OpenBSD will gather its IP address, default gateway and DNS servers from
the DHCP server at startup time.

<p>
If you want to get an IP via DHCP from the command line, simply run:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>dhclient xl0</b>
</pre>

Replace <code>xl0</code> with your interface name.

<p>
The <code>resolv.conf</code> file will be overwritten by
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient">dhclient(8)</a> if the DHCP
server provides the domain-name, domain-search or domain-name-servers
options.
Any of these can be ignored, overridden or modified with appropriate
statements in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf">dhclient.conf(5)</a>.
For example, if you wanted to use the DNS server at 1.2.3.4 rather than
the one(s) the DHCP server provided, add the following:

<pre class="cmdbox">
supersede domain-name-servers 1.2.3.4;
</pre>

Additionally, the file <code>/etc/resolv.conf.tail</code> can be used to
append information if <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient">dhclient(8)</a>
does write <code>resolv.conf</code>.

<h3 id="DHCPserver">DHCP Server</h3>

If you want to use OpenBSD as a DHCP server, enable the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd">dhcpd(8)</a> daemon at startup.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl enable dhcpd</b>
</pre>

On the next boot, dhcpd will run and attach to all NICs that have valid
configurations in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.conf">dhcpd.conf(5)</a>.
You may specify individual interfaces instead by naming them explicitly.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl set dhcpd flags em1 em2</b>
</pre>

An example <code>/etc/dhcpd.conf</code> file might look like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# Home
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.2;
	option routers 192.168.1.1;
	range 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.50;
}

# Guests
subnet 172.16.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	option domain-name-servers 209.244.0.3, 8.8.8.8;
	option routers 172.16.0.1;
	range 172.16.0.2 172.16.0.254;
}
</pre>

There are two subnets in this example: a home network and a guest network.
Clients will automatically be given an IP address and pointed to the gateway
and DNS servers you specify.
See <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcp-options">dhcp-options(5)</a> for more
options.

<h3 id="PXE">PXE Booting (i386, amd64)</h3>

The Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) is a standard method of booting systems
using only the network.
A client's PXE-capable NIC broadcasts a DHCP request at the start of the
<a href="faq14.html#BootAmd64">boot process</a> and, rather than only receiving
basic IP/DNS information, is also given a file to boot from.
On OpenBSD, this file is known as
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pxeboot">pxeboot(8)</a>, and is typically
served by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tftpd">tftpd(8)</a>.

<h2 id="Wireless">Wireless Networking</h2>

OpenBSD has support for
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=wireless&amp;apropos=1">a number of
wireless chipsets</a>.
Further supported devices can be found in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/usb">usb(4)</a> and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pci">pci(4)</a>.
The precise extent of their support is described in the driver man pages.

<p>
The following cards support Host-based Access Point (HostAP) mode, permitting
them to be used as a <a href="pf/example1.html">wireless access point</a>:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acx">acx(4)</a>
    TI ACX100/ACX111
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ath">ath(4)</a>
    Atheros 802.11a/b/g
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/athn">athn(4)</a>
    Atheros 802.11/a/g/n devices
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pgt">pgt(4)</a>
    Conexant/Intersil Prism GT Full-MAC 802.11a/b/g
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ral">ral(4)</a>
    and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ural">ural(4)</a>
    Ralink Technology RT25x0 802.11a/b/g
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rtw">rtw(4)</a>
    Realtek 8180 802.11b
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rum">rum(4)</a>
    Ralink Technology RT2501USB
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wi">wi(4)</a>
    Prism2/2.5/3
</ul>

The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a>
<code>media</code> subcommand shows media capabilities of network interfaces.
For wireless devices, it displays supported 802.11a/b/g/n media modes and the
supported operating modes (<code>hostap</code>, <code>ibss</code>,
<code>monitor</code>).
For example, to see media capabilities of interface <code>ath0</code>, type:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>ifconfig ath0 media</b>
</pre>

In order to use some wireless cards, you will need to acquire firmware files
with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update">fw_update(1)</a>.
Some manufacturers refuse to allow <a href="faq1.html#ReallyFree">free</a>
distribution of their firmware, so it can't be included with OpenBSD.

<p>
Another option to consider: use a conventional NIC and an external bridging
wireless access point for your OpenBSD-based firewall.
This has the added advantage of letting you easily position the antenna where it
is most effective, which is often not directly on the back of your firewall.

<h3>Configuring Your Wireless Adapter</h3>

Adapters based on supported chips can be used like any other network interface.
To connect an OpenBSD system to an existing wireless network, use the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a> utility.

<p>
An example of a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if">hostname.if(5)</a>
file for a wireless client might be:

<pre class="cmdbox">
nwid puffyuberalles
wpakey passwordhere
dhcp
</pre>

Note that the <code>dhcp</code> keyword should be after the other configuration
lines, as the network adapter will not be able to send a DHCP request until
it is configured.

<h3>Trunking Your Wireless Adapter</h3>

Trunks are virtual interfaces consisting of one or more network interfaces.
In this section, our example will be a laptop with a wired
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bge">bge0</a> interface and a wireless
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwn">iwn0</a> interface.
We will build a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/trunk">trunk(4)</a> interface
using both of them.

<p>
To do this, we first activate the two physical ports, then assign them to
<code>trunk0</code>.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>echo up > /etc/hostname.bge0</b>
</pre>

The wireless interface, however, needs a bit more configuration.
It will need to attach to our wireless WPA-protected network:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>cat /etc/hostname.iwn0</b>
nwid puffynet
wpakey mysecretkey
up
</pre>

Now, our trunk interface is defined like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>cat /etc/hostname.trunk0</b>
trunkproto failover trunkport bge0
trunkport iwn0
dhcp
</pre>

The trunk is set up in <code>failover</code> mode,
so either interface can be used.
If both are available, it will prefer the <code>bge0</code> port,
since that is the first one added to the trunk device.

<h2 id="Bridge">Setting Up a Network Bridge</h2>

A <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bridge">bridge(4)</a> is a link between two
or more separate networks.
Unlike a router, packets go through the bridge transparently: the two network
segments appear as one to nodes on either side.
Bridges will only forward packets that have to pass from one segment to the
other and, as a result, an interface in a bridge may or may not have an IP
address of its own.
If it does, the interface has effectively two modes of operation: one as part
of a bridge, the other as a stand-alone NIC.
If neither interface has an IP address, the bridge will pass network data,
but will not be externally maintainable (which can be a feature).

<h3>A Bridge Acting as a DHCP Server</h3>

Let's say we have a system which has four
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vr">vr(4)</a> interfaces,
<code>vr0</code> through <code>vr3</code>.
We want to bridge <code>vr1</code>, <code>vr2</code> and <code>vr3</code>
together, leaving out <code>vr0</code> for the uplink.
We also want to serve IP addresses through DHCP over the bridged interfaces.
Being a DHCP server and an uplink router, the box needs to have an IP address
on the bridged network.

<p>
It is not possible to assign an IP address directly to a bridge interface.
The IP address should be added to one of the member interfaces, but we cannot
use a physical interface as the link might be down, in which case the address
would not be reachable.
Fortunately, there is the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vether">vether(4)</a>
(virtual Ethernet) driver that can be used for this purpose.
We will add it to the bridge, assign the IP address to it and make
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd">dhcpd(8)</a> listen there.

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="#DHCPserver">DHCP server configuration</a> is not described
      yet again in this section, but the addressing scheme used here is the
      same.
  <li>This will also be the uplink router for your bridged network, so we will
      use IP address 192.168.1.1 to match the DHCP server configuration.
  <li>We will not cover the uplink, routing or firewalling configuration here.
</ul>

First, mark the <code>vr1</code>, <code>vr2</code> and <code>vr3</code>
interfaces as up:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>echo up > /etc/hostname.vr1</b>
# <b>echo up > /etc/hostname.vr2</b>
# <b>echo up > /etc/hostname.vr3</b>
</pre>

Then create the <code>vether0</code> configuration:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>echo 'inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.255' > /etc/hostname.vether0</b>
</pre>

Configure the bridge interface to contain all the above interfaces:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>cat /etc/hostname.bridge0</b>
add vether0
add vr1
add vr2
add vr3
up
</pre>

And finally we make the DHCP daemon listen on the <code>vether0</code>
interface:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl set dhcpd flags vether0</b>
</pre>

Reboot, and voil&agrave;!

<h3>Filtering on a Bridge</h3>

While there are certainly uses for a simple bridge like this, it is likely you
might want to DO something with the packets as they go through your bridge.
As you might expect, <a href="pf/index.html">Packet Filter</a> can be used to
restrict what traffic goes through your bridge.
Keep in mind, by the nature of a bridge, the same data flows through both
interfaces, so you only need to filter on one interface.

<h3>Tips on Bridging</h3>

<ul>
  <li>By using the <code>blocknonip</code> option of
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a> or in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if">hostname.bridge0</a>,
      you can prevent non-IP traffic (such as IPX or NETBEUI) from slipping
      around your filters.
      This may be important in some situations, but you should be aware that
      bridges work for all kinds of traffic, not just IP.
  <li>Bridging requires that the NICs be in a promiscuous mode.
      They listen to <b>all</b> network traffic, not just that directed at
      the interface.
      This will put a higher load on the processor and bus than one might
      expect.
</ul>

<h2 id="Multipath">Equal-cost Multipath Routing</h2>

Equal-cost multipath routing refers to having multiple routes in the routing
table for the same network, such as the default route, <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>.
When the kernel is doing a route lookup to determine where to send packets
destined to that network, it can choose from any of the equal-cost routes.
In most scenarios, multipath routing is used to provide redundant uplink
connections, e.g., redundant connections to the internet.

<p>
The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/route">route(8)</a> command is used to
add/change/delete routes in the routing table.
The <code>-mpath</code> argument is used when adding multipath routes.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>route add -mpath default 10.130.128.1</b>
# <b>route add -mpath default 10.132.0.1</b>
</pre>

Verify the routes:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>netstat -rnf inet | grep default</b>
default     10.130.128.1      UGS       2      134      -     fxp1
default     10.132.0.1        UGS       0      172      -     fxp2
</pre>

In this example we can see that one default route points to
<code>10.130.128.1</code>, which is accessible via the <code>fxp1</code>
interface, and the other points to <code>10.132.0.1</code>, which is accessible
via <code>fxp2</code>.

<p>
Since the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mygate">mygate(5)</a> file does not
yet support multipath default routes, the above commands should be added to the
bottom of the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if">hostname.if(5)</a>
files for the <code>fxp1</code> and <code>fxp2</code> interfaces.
The <code>/etc/mygate</code> file should then be deleted.

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>tail -1 /etc/hostname.fxp1</b>
!route add -mpath default 10.130.128.1
$ <b>tail -1 /etc/hostname.fxp2</b>
!route add -mpath default 10.132.0.1
</pre>

Lastly, don't forget to activate the use of multipath routes by enabling the
proper <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.8">sysctl(8)</a> variable.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>sysctl net.inet.ip.multipath=1</b>
# <b>sysctl net.inet6.ip6.multipath=1</b>
</pre>

Be sure to edit <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.conf">sysctl.conf(5)</a>
to make the changes permanent.

<p>
Now try a traceroute to different destinations.
The kernel will load balance the traffic over each multipath route.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>traceroute -n 154.11.0.4</b>
traceroute to 154.11.0.4 (154.11.0.4), 64 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  10.130.128.1  19.337 ms  18.194 ms  18.849 ms
 2  154.11.95.170  17.642 ms  18.176 ms  17.731 ms
 3  154.11.5.33  110.486 ms  19.478 ms  100.949 ms
 4  154.11.0.4  32.772 ms  33.534 ms  32.835 ms

# <b>traceroute -n 154.11.0.5</b>
traceroute to 154.11.0.5 (154.11.0.5), 64 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  10.132.0.1  14.175 ms  14.503 ms  14.58 ms
 2  154.11.95.38  13.664 ms  13.962 ms  13.445 ms
 3  208.38.16.151  13.964 ms  13.347 ms  13.788 ms
 4  154.11.0.5  30.177 ms  30.95 ms  30.593 ms
</pre>

For more information about how the route is chosen, please refer to
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2992.txt">RFC2992</a>, "Analysis of an
Equal-Cost Multi-Path Algorithm".

<p>
It's worth noting that if an interface used by a multipath route goes down
(i.e., loses carrier), the kernel will still try to forward packets using the
route that points to that interface.
This traffic will of course be blackholed and end up going nowhere.
It's highly recommended to use
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifstated">ifstated(8)</a> to check for
unavailable interfaces and adjust the routing table accordingly.

<h2 id="VMMnet">Networking vmm Guests</h2>

Network access to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm">vmm(4)</a> guests
can be configured a number of different ways, four of which are detailed
in this section.

<p>
In the examples below, various IPv4 address ranges will be mentioned for
different use cases:

<ul>
  <li><b>Private Addresses</b>
      (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC1918</a>) are those
      reserved for private networks such as <code>10.0.0.0/8</code>,
      <code>172.16.0.0/12</code>, and <code>192.168.0.0/24</code> are not
      globally routable.
  <li><b>Shared Addresses</b>
      (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598">RFC6598</a>) are similar
      to private addresses in that they are not globally routable, but are
      intended to be used on equipment that can perform address translation.
      The address space is <code>100.64.0.0/10</code>.
</ul>

<h3>Option 1 - VMs only need to talk to the host and each other</h3>

For this setup, vmm uses <i>local interfaces</i>: interfaces that use
the shared address space defined above.

<p>
Using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmctl">vmctl(8)</a>'s <code>-L</code>
flag creates a local interface in the guest which will receive an address
from vmm via DHCP.
This essentially creates two interfaces: one for the host and the other
for the VM.

<h3>Option 2 - NAT for the VMs</h3>

This setup builds upon the previous and allows VMs to connect outside
the host.
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2#ip.forwarding">IP forwarding</a>
is required for it to work.

<p>
The following line in <code>/etc/pf.conf</code> will enable
<a href="pf/nat.html">Network Address Translation</a>:

<pre class="cmdbox">
match out on egress from 100.64.0.0/10 to any nat-to (egress)
</pre>

Reload the pf ruleset and the VM(s) can now connect to the internet.

<h3>Option 3 - Additional control over the VM network configuration</h3>

Sometimes you may want additional control over the virtual network for your
VMs, such as being able to put certain ones on their own virtual switch.
This can be done using a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bridge">bridge(4)</a>
and a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vether">vether(4)</a> interface.

<p>
Create a <code>vether0</code> interface that will have a private IPv4 address
as defined above.
In this example, we'll use the <code>10.0.0.0/8</code> subnet.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>echo 'inet 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0' > /etc/hostname.vether0</b>
# <b>sh /etc/netstart vether0</b>
</pre>

Create the <code>bridge0</code> interface with the <code>vether0</code>
interface as a bridge port:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>echo 'add vether0' > /etc/hostname.bridge0</b>
# <b>sh /etc/netstart bridge0</b>
</pre>

Ensure that NAT is set up properly if the guests on the virtual network
need access beyond the physical machine.
An adjusted NAT line in <code>/etc/pf.conf</code> might look like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
match out on egress from vether0:network to any nat-to (egress)
</pre>

The following lines in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a>
can be used to ensure that a virtual switch is defined:

<pre class="cmdbox">
switch "my_switch" {
    interface bridge0
}

vm "my_vm" {
    ...
    interface { switch "my_switch" }
}
</pre>

Inside the <code>my_vm</code> guest, it's now possible to assign
<code>vio0</code>
an address on the <code>10.0.0.0/24</code> network and set the default route to
<code>10.0.0.1</code>.

<p>
For convenience, you may wish to set up a <a href="#DHCP">DHCP server</a>
on <code>vether0</code>.

<h3>Option 4 - VMs as real hosts on the same network</h3>

In this scenario, the VM interface will be attached to the same network as
the host so can it be configured as if it were physically connected to the
host network.
This option only works for Ethernet-based devices, as the IEEE 802.11 standard
prevents wireless interfaces from participating in network bridges.

<p>
Create the <code>vether0</code> interface:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>echo 'up' > /etc/hostname.vether0</b>
# <b>sh /etc/netstart vether0</b>
</pre>

The <code>vether0</code> interface will be used as the local interface for the
host that is managed via DHCP on the host network.

<p>
Create the <code>bridge0</code> interface with the host network interface as a
bridge port, along with the newly created <code>vether0</code> interface.
In this example, the host network interface is <code>em0</code> - you should
substitute the interface name that you wish to connect the VM to:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>echo 'add em0' > /etc/hostname.bridge0</b>
# <b>echo 'add vether0' >> /etc/hostname.bridge0</b>
# <b>sh /etc/netstart bridge0</b>
</pre>

As done in the previous example, create or modify the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a> file to ensure
that a virtual switch is defined:

<pre class="cmdbox">
switch "my_switch" {
    interface bridge0
}

vm "my_vm" {
    ...
    interface { switch "my_switch" }
}
</pre>

The <code>my_vm</code> guest can now participate in the host network as if it
were physically connected.
<p>

<b>Note:</b> If the host interface (<code>em0</code> in the above example) is
also configured using DHCP,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient">dhclient(8)</a> running on that
interface may block DHCP requests from reaching guest VMs.
In this case, you should select a different host interface not using DHCP,
or terminate any <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient">dhclient(8)</a>
processes assigned to that interface before starting VMs, or use static IP
addresses for the VMs.

<h2 id="NFS">Using NFS</h2>

The Network File System, NFS, is used to share a filesystem over the network.

<p>
This section will go through the steps for a simple NFS setup.
The example details a server on a LAN, with clients accessing NFS on the LAN.
It does not cover securing NFS.
We presume you have already set up packet filtering or other firewalling
protection to prevent outside access.

<h3>Setting Up an NFS Server</h3>

First, enable the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/portmap">portmap(8)</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mountd">mountd(8)</a> and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nfsd">nfsd(8)</a> services on the server:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl enable portmap mountd nfsd</b>
</pre>

Then configure the list of filesystems that will be made available.

<p>
In this example, we have a server with IP address <code>10.0.0.1</code>.
This server will be serving NFS only to clients within its own subnet.
This is configured in the following
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/exports">exports(5)</a> file:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>cat /etc/exports</b>
/docs -alldirs -ro -network=10.0.0 -mask=255.255.255.0
</pre>

The local filesystem <code>/docs</code> will be made available via NFS.
The <code>-alldirs</code> option specifies that clients will be able to mount at
any point under <code>/docs</code> as well as <code>/docs</code> itself.
The <code>-ro</code> option specifies that clients will only be granted
read-only access.
The last two arguments specify that only clients within the
<code>10.0.0.0</code>
network using a netmask of <code>255.255.255.0</code>
will be authorized to mount this filesystem.

<p>
Now you can start the server services.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl start portmap mountd nfsd</b>
</pre>

If you make changes to <code>/etc/exports</code> while NFS is already running,
you need to make mountd aware of this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl reload mountd</b>
</pre>

<h3>Mounting NFS Filesystems</h3>

NFS filesystems should be mounted via
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount_nfs">mount(8)</a>, or more specifically,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount_nfs">mount_nfs(8)</a>.

<p>
To mount the <code>/docs</code> filesystem on host <code>10.0.0.1</code>
to local filesystem <code>/mnt</code>, run:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>mount -t nfs 10.0.0.1:/docs /mnt</b>
</pre>

To have that filesystem mounted at boot, append a line to your
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fstab">fstab(5)</a>:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>echo '10.0.0.1:/docs /mnt nfs ro,nodev,nosuid 0 0' >> /etc/fstab</b>
</pre>

It is important that you use <code>0 0</code> at the end of this line so that
your computer does not try to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fsck">fsck(8)</a>
the NFS filesystem on boot.

<p>
When accessing an NFS mount as the root user, the server automatically maps
root's access to username <code>nobody</code> and group <code>nobody</code>.
This is important to know when considering file permissions.
For example, take a file with these permissions:

<pre class="cmdbox">
-rw-------    1 root     wheel           0 Dec 31 03:00 _daily.B20143
</pre>

If this file was on an NFS share and the root user tried to access this file
from the NFS client, access would be denied.

<p>
The user and group that root are mapped to are configurable via the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/exports">exports(5)</a> file on the NFS server.

<h3>Checking Stats on NFS</h3>

One thing to check to ensure NFS is operating properly is that all the daemons
have properly registered with RPC.
To do this, use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpcinfo">rpcinfo(8)</a>.

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>rpcinfo -p 10.0.0.1</b>
   program vers proto   port
    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
    100005    1   udp    633  mountd
    100005    3   udp    633  mountd
    100005    1   tcp    916  mountd
    100005    3   tcp    916  mountd
    100003    2   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    3   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    2   tcp   2049  nfs
    100003    3   tcp   2049  nfs
</pre>

There are a few utilities that allow you to see what is happening with NFS.
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/showmount">showmount(8)</a> allows you to view
what is currently mounted by whom.
There is also <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nfsstat">nfsstat(1)</a>, which
shows much more verbose statistics.
