<h2 id="Overview">Overview of the installation procedure</h2>

OpenBSD has long been respected for its simple and straightforward installation
process, which is very consistent across all platforms.
<!-- XXXrelease - remove cd mentions for 6.1 -->
You are urged to read the platform-specific INSTALL document on the CD-ROM or
mirror sites.
For example, <tt>i386/INSTALL.i386</tt> or <tt>amd64/INSTALL.amd64</tt>.

The OpenBSD installer is a <a href="#bsd.rd">special kernel</a> available on:

<ul>
  <li><b>CD-ROM:</b>
    CD-ROM images for creating a <a href="#MkInsMedia">bootable CD-ROM</a>.
    <tt>cdXX.iso</tt> is for just booting, while <tt>installXX.iso</tt> is for
    the entire install.
  <li><b>USB drives:</b>
    Raw disk images for creating <a href="#MkInsMedia">bootable USB drives</a>.
    <tt>minirootXX.fs</tt> is for just booting, while <tt>installXX.fs</tt>
    is for the entire install.
  <li><b>Existing partition:</b>
    The <a href="#bsd.rd">RAM disk kernel</a> can be booted off an already
    existing partition for an upgrade or reinstall.
  <li><b>Network:</b>
    Some platforms support booting over a network, for example using
    <a href="faq6.html#PXE">PXE</a> or other
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/diskless">network boot</a>.
  <li><b>Floppy disk:</b>
    Images for making <a href="#MkInsMedia">bootable floppies</a>
    are also provided.
</ul>

Not every <a href="../plat.html">platform</a> supports all boot options:

<ul>
  <li><a href="../alpha.html"><b>alpha:</b></a>
    CD-ROM, network, writing a floppy image to hard disk, floppy.
  <li><a href="../amd64.html"><b>amd64:</b></a>
    CD-ROM, miniroot, <a href="faq6.html#PXE">network</a>, floppy.
  <li><a href="../hppa.html"><b>hppa:</b></a>
    Network.
  <li><a href="../i386.html"><b>i386:</b></a>
    CD-ROM, miniroot, <a href="faq6.html#PXE">network</a>, floppy.
  <li><a href="../landisk.html"><b>landisk:</b></a>
    Miniroot, installed using another computer.
  <li><a href="../loongson.html"><b>loongson:</b></a>
    Miniroot, existing OS partition.
  <li><a href="../luna88k.html"><b>luna88k:</b></a>
    Network.
  <li><a href="../macppc.html"><b>macppc:</b></a>
    CD-ROM, network.
  <li><a href="../octeon.html"><b>octeon:</b></a>
    Network.
  <li><a href="../sgi.html"><b>sgi:</b></a>
    CD-ROM, network.
  <li><a href="../socppc.html"><b>socppc:</b></a>
    Network.
  <li><a href="../sparc64.html"><b>sparc64:</b></a>
    CD-ROM, network, writing image to existing partition, floppy (U1/U2 only).
</ul>

All platforms can use <a href="#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> to reinstall or upgrade.

<p>
Once the install kernel is booted, you have several options of where to get
the <a href="#FilesNeeded">install file sets</a>.
Again, not every platform supports every option.

<ul>
  <li><b>CD-ROM:</b>
    <!-- XXXrelease - remove cd mentions for 6.1 -->
    Of course, we prefer you use the
    <a href="../orders.html">official CD-ROM set</a>, but you can also use
    <tt>installXX.iso</tt> or you can make your own.
  <li><b>HTTP:</b>
    Either one of the OpenBSD <a href="../ftp.html#http">mirror sites</a>
    or your own local web server holding the file sets.
  <li><b>Local disk partition:</b>
    In many cases, you can install file sets from another partition on a local
    hard disk.
    For example, on <a href="../i386.html">i386</a>, you can install from a FAT
    partition or a CD-ROM formatted in ISO 9660, Rock Ridge or Joliet format.
    In some cases, you will have to manually mount the file system before using
    it.
  <li><b>NFS:</b>
    Some platforms support using NFS mounts for the file sets.
</ul>

<h2 id="Checklist">Pre-installation checklist</h2>

Before you start, you should have some idea what you want to end up with.
You will want to know the following items, at least:

<ul>
  <li>Machine name.
  <li>Hardware installed and available:
    <ul>
      <li>Verify compatibility with your platform's hardware compatibility page.
    </ul>
  <li>Install method to be used.
  <li>Should an important bug be found, how will the system be patched?
    <ul>
      <li>If done locally, you will need to have
        <a href="#Partitioning">sufficient space</a> available for the
        source tree and building it.
      <li>Otherwise, you will need access to another machine to build a patched
        <a href="faq5.html#Release">release</a> on.
    </ul>
  <li>Desired disk layout:
    <ul>
      <li>Does existing data need to be saved elsewhere?
      <li>Will OpenBSD coexist on this system with another OS?
        If so, how will each system be booted?
        Will you need to install a boot manager?
      <li>Will the entire disk be used for OpenBSD, or do you want to
        keep an existing partition/OS (or space for a future one)?
      <li>How do you wish to sub-partition the OpenBSD part of your disk?
    </ul>
  <li>Network settings, if not using DHCP:
    <ul>
      <li>Domain name.
      <li>Domain Name Server(s) (DNS) address.
      <li>IP addresses and subnet masks for each NIC.
      <li>Gateway address.
    </ul>
  <li>Will you be running the X Window System?
  <li>Do you want to set up <a href="faq14.html#softraidFDE">full disk
      encryption</a>?
</ul>

<h2 id="Download">Downloading OpenBSD</h2>

There are numerous international mirror sites offering access to OpenBSD
releases and snapshots.
You should always use the site nearest to you.
Before you begin fetching a release or snapshot, you may wish to use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ping">ping(8)</a> and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/traceroute">traceroute(8)</a> to determine
which mirror site is nearest to you, and whether that mirror is performing
adequately.
Access information can be found <a href= "../ftp.html">here</a>.
Of course, your OpenBSD release CD is always closer than any mirror.

<p>
In the same directory as the installation sets, each mirror includes a file
named <tt>SHA256</tt> that contains checksums of the various installation
files.
You can confirm that none of the downloaded files were mangled in transit
using the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sha256">sha256(1)</a> command.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>sha256 -c SHA256</b>
</pre></blockquote>

However, this only checks for <i>accidental</i> corruption.
You can use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/signify">signify(1)</a>
to cryptographically verify the downloaded files.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>signify -Cp /etc/signify/openbsd-XX-base.pub -x SHA256.sig install*.iso</b>
Signature Verified
installXX.iso: OK
</pre></blockquote>

This will verify the <tt>installXX.iso</tt> file, for example.
Replace "XX" with the version of OpenBSD that you're verifying.
Note that you will need the public key files for OpenBSD's base system
(and the signify program!) in order to do this.

<h2 id="MkInsMedia">Creating bootable install media</h2>

As an example, these are the installation images available for the
<a href="../i386.html">i386</a> platform:

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>cdXX.iso</tt></b> is an ISO 9660 image that can be used to create
    a bootable CD with most popular CD-ROM creation software on most platforms.
    This image has the widest selection of drivers, and is usually the
    recommended choice if your hardware can boot from a CD-ROM.
    The install file sets are not included and need to be pulled down from the
    network or another disk.
  <li><b><tt>minirootXX.fs</tt></b> is a disk image that can be written to a
    bootable device, such as a USB flash drive, and booted for the install.
    As in <tt>cdXX.iso</tt>, the install file sets are not included.
  <li><b><tt>installXX.iso</tt></b> much like <tt>cdXX.iso</tt>, but also
    includes all the file sets.
    This file can be used to create a CD that can do a stand-alone
    OpenBSD install.
  <li><b><tt>installXX.fs</tt></b> much like <tt>minirootXX.fs</tt>, but also
    includes all the file sets.
  <li><b><tt>floppyXX.fs</tt></b> supports many older machines that lack
    bootable CD-ROMs.
</ul>

<h3 id="MkFlash">Flash drives</h3>

A bootable USB flash drive can be created by attaching the target device and
copying over the image with <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dd">dd(1)</a>.

<p>
Using OpenBSD, assuming the device was recognized as <tt>sd6</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>dd if=/location/install*.fs of=/dev/rsd6c bs=1m</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Details of this will vary on other platforms.
Note that the <b>raw I/O device</b> is used in its entirety:
<tt><b>r</b>sd6<b>c</b></tt>.
In some Linux variants, the entire seventh <tt>sd</tt> disk would be
<tt>/dev/sdg</tt>.

<h3 id="MkCD-ROM">CD-ROMs</h3>

You can create a CD-ROM using the <tt>cdXX.iso</tt> or <tt>installXX.iso</tt>
files.
In OpenBSD, use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cdio">cdio(1)</a>:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cdio tao cd*.iso</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="MkFlop">Floppies</h3>

Creating floppies in OpenBSD can be done with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdformat">fdformat(1)</a> to prep the disk,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dd">dd(1)</a> to write the image, then
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cmp">cmp(1)</a> to verify the write was good.
A similar process can be used on other Unix platforms.

<h2 id="Boot">Booting the install media</h2>

<h3>Booting i386/amd64</h3>

Booting install media on the i386 and amd64 PC platforms is nothing new to most
people.
Your system will have to be instructed to boot from whatever media you have
chosen to use, usually through a BIOS setup option.
If you want to boot from CD or a USB device, your system BIOS must be able to
do so.
Some machines are buggy with regard to booting from USB devices;
a BIOS update may help.

<p>
You can also install by booting <a href="#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> from an
existing OpenBSD partition, or over the network using the
<a href="faq6.html#PXE">PXE boot process</a>.

<h3>Booting sparc64</h3>

<b>NOTE:</b>
On the <a href="../sparc64.html">sparc64</a> platform, only the SBus
machines (Ultra 1, Ultra 2) are bootable from floppy.

<p>
You will need the system to be at a monitor ROM prompt, which typically looks
like <tt>ok</tt>.
If you are using a Sun keyboard, press and hold <tt>STOP</tt> while tapping
<tt>A</tt>.
If using a serial console, a <tt>BREAK</tt> should return you to the monitor
prompt.

<p>
Use the following commands to boot from a floppy or a CD-ROM:

<blockquote><pre>
ok <b>boot floppy</b>
</pre></blockquote>

or

<blockquote><pre>
ok <b>boot cdrom</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="Install">Performing a simple install</h2>

The installer is designed to install OpenBSD in a very usable default
configuration with a minimum of user intervention.
In fact, you can often just hit <tt>&lt;Enter&gt;</tt> to get a good OpenBSD
install, moving your hands to the rest of the keyboard only to enter the
root password and to reboot at the end.

<p>
The installer will create a partitioning plan based on the size of your
hard disk.
While this will not be a perfect layout for all people, it provides a
good starting point for figuring out what you need.

<p>
<!-- XXXrelease - remove cd mentions for 6.1 -->
Installation notes for each platform are on the install CDs and the mirrors,
in the file <tt>INSTALL.&lt;plat&gt;</tt>, where <tt>&lt;plat&gt;</tt> is your
<a href="../plat.html">platform</a>, for instance, <tt>i386</tt>.
Read it.

<p>
Whatever your means of <a href="#Boot">booting</a> is, it is now time to use it.
When your boot is successful, you will see a lot of text messages scroll by.
This text is the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dmesg">dmesg(8)</a>,
the kernel telling you what devices have been found and how they are
hooked to other devices.

<p>
After the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dmesg">dmesg(8)</a>, you will see the
first installer question:

<blockquote><pre>
...
root on rd0a swap on rd0b dump on rd0b
erase ^?, werase ^W, kill ^U, intr ^C, status ^T

Welcome to the OpenBSD/i386 X.X installation program.
(I)nstall, (U)pgrade, (A)utoinstall or (S)hell?
</pre></blockquote>

Choose <tt>(I)nstall</tt> and follow the instructions.

<h2 id="FilesNeeded">What files are needed for installation?</h2>

The complete OpenBSD installation is broken up into a number of file sets.
New users are recommended to install all of them.

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>bsd</tt></b>
    - the kernel <b>(required)</b>
  <li><b><tt>bsd.mp</tt></b>
    - the multi-processor kernel (only on some platforms)
  <li><b><tt>bsd.rd</tt></b>
    - the <a href="#bsd.rd">RAM disk kernel</a>
  <li><b><tt>baseXX.tgz</tt></b>
    - the base OpenBSD system <b>(required)</b>
  <li><b><tt>compXX.tgz</tt></b>
    - the compiler collection, headers and libraries
  <li><b><tt>manXX.tgz</tt></b>
    - man pages
  <li><b><tt>gameXX.tgz</tt></b>
    - text-based games
  <li><b><tt>xbaseXX.tgz</tt></b>
    - the base libraries and utilities for X11 (requires <tt>xshareXX.tgz</tt>)
  <li><b><tt>xfontXX.tgz</tt></b>
    - fonts used by X11
  <li><b><tt>xservXX.tgz</tt></b>
    - X11's X servers
  <li><b><tt>xshareXX.tgz</tt></b>
    - X11's man pages, locale settings, includes
</ul>

<h3>Adding a file set after install</h3>

If you chose to skip some file sets at install time, you might realize later
that you really do need them after all.

<p>
Simply boot <a href="#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> from your root file system and
choose <tt>(U)pgrade</tt>.
When you get to the list of file sets, select the ones you need.

<h3 id="FilesNeededX">Why do I have to install X for my non-graphical
application?</h3>

Some libraries from <tt>xbaseXX.tgz</tt>, like freetype or fontconfig, can be
used outside of X by programs that manipulate text or graphics.
Such programs will usually need fonts, either from <tt>xfontXX.tgz</tt> or
font packages.
For the sake of simplicity, the developers decided against maintaining a minimal
<tt>xbaseXX.tgz</tt> set that would allow most non-X ports to run.

<p>
The <tt>xservXX.tgz</tt> set is rarely needed if you don't intend to run X.

<h3 id="FilesNeededComp">I don't want to install the compilers</h3>

Ok, don't, but please don't tell yourself this is for security reasons.
By the time someone is far enough into your system that the presence or
absence of the compiler matters, they are far enough in they can install
a compiler themselves.
However, the <tt>compXX.tgz</tt> file set is relatively big and has a lot of
files in it, so it can take a while to install and upgrade.
On slow or small systems, this can matter.

<h2 id="Partitioning">How should I partition my disk?</h2>

OpenBSD can be installed in as little as 512MB, but using a device that small
is something for advanced users.
Until you have some experience, 8GB or more disk space is recommended.

<p>
Unlike some other operating systems, OpenBSD encourages users to split their
disk into a number of partitions, rather than just one or two large ones.
Some of the reasons for doing so are:

<ul>
  <li><b>Security:</b>
    You can mark some filesystems with
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount">mount(8)</a> options such as as
    <tt>nosuid</tt>, <tt>nodev</tt>, <tt>noexec</tt>, <tt>wxallowed</tt> or
    <tt>readonly</tt> in <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fstab">fstab(5)</a>.
  <li><b>Stability:</b>
    A user or a misbehaved program can fill a filesystem with garbage if they
    have write permissions for it.
    Your critical programs, which hopefully run on a different filesystem,
    do not get interrupted.
  <li><b>Speed:</b>
    A filesystem which gets written to frequently may get somewhat fragmented.
    Luckily, the OpenBSD FFS filesystem is not prone to heavy fragmentation.
  <li><b>Integrity:</b>
    If one filesystem is corrupted for some reason, then your other filesystems
    are most likely still OK.
  <li><b><a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fsck">fsck(8)</a>:</b>
    You can mount partitions that you never or rarely need to write to as
    <tt>readonly</tt> most of the time, which will eliminate the need for
    fsck(8) after a crash or power interruption.
</ul>

Read the section on automatic disk allocation in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a> and the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/hier">hier(7)</a> man page before making
decisions about custom partitioning schemes.

<h2 id="AddThoughts">Additional thoughts on partitioning</h2>

<ul>
  <li>For experimenting, one big <tt>/</tt> partition and <tt>swap</tt> may be
    easiest until you know how much space you need.
    By doing this, you will be sacrificing some of the default security features
    of OpenBSD that require separate filesystems for <tt>/</tt>, <tt>/tmp</tt>,
    <tt>/var</tt>, <tt>/usr</tt> and <tt>/home</tt>.
    Note that some programs installed through <a href="faq15.html">packages</a>
    will require a separate <tt>/usr/local</tt> partition mounted with the
    <tt>wxallowed</tt> option to function properly.
  <li>You do <b>not</b> have to allocate all space when you set the system up.
    If you outgrow a partition, you can allocate a new partition from your
    unused space.
    Then <a href="faq10.html#DupFS">duplicate</a> your existing partition to the
    new partition, change <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fstab">fstab(5)</a>
    to point to the new partition, remount, you now have more space.
  <li>If you make your partitions too close to the minimum size required, you
    will probably regret it later, when it is time to upgrade your system.
  <li>If you make very large partitions, keep in mind that performing
    filesystem checks using <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fsck">fsck(8)</a>
    requires about 1MB of RAM per gigabyte of filesystem size.
  <li>A <tt>/home</tt> partition can be nice.
    New version of the OS?
    Wipe and reload everything else, leave your <tt>/home</tt> partition
    untouched.
    Remember to save a copy of your configuration files.
  <li>You may also want to create an <tt>/altroot</tt> partition, as
    described in <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/daily">daily(8)</a> and the
    <a href="faq14.html#altroot">altroot</a> section of the FAQ.
  <li>A system exposed to the Internet or other hostile forces should have a
    separate <tt>/var</tt> and maybe even a separate <tt>/var/log</tt>.
  <li>If you permit users to write to <tt>/var/www</tt> (personal web pages),
    you might wish to put it on a separate partition, so you can use
    <a href="faq10.html#Quotas">quotas</a> to restrict the space they use.
  <li>
    If you wish to <a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a>, you
    will need room for <tt>/usr/src</tt> and <tt>/usr/obj</tt>.
    Create separate partitions for them or make sure <tt>/usr</tt> is
    sufficiently large.
  <li>Compiling some <a href="faq15.html#Ports">ports</a> from source
    can take huge amounts of space on your <tt>/usr</tt> and <tt>/tmp</tt>
    partitions.
    This is another reason we suggest using
    <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">pre-compiled packages</a> instead.
    <li>At least some editors use <tt>/tmp</tt> for scratch space, and
    this often needs to be as big or bigger than the largest file you edit.
    If you plan on editing 500MB files, your <tt>/tmp</tt> partition will
    need to be much larger than you might have planned on.
</ul>

<h2 id= "SendDmesg">Sending your dmesg after the install</h2>

A quote from <tt>/usr/src/etc/root/root.mail</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
If you wish to ensure that OpenBSD runs better on your machines, please do us
a favor (after you have your mail system configured!) and type something like:

# <b>(dmesg; sysctl hw.sensors) | \
   mail -s "Sony VAIO 505R laptop, apm works OK" dmesg@openbsd.org</b>

so that we can see what kinds of configurations people are running.  As shown,
including a bit of information about your machine in the subject or the body
can help us even further.  We will use this information to improve device driver
support in future releases.  (Please do this using the supplied GENERIC kernel,
not for a custom compiled kernel, unless you're unable to boot the GENERIC
kernel.  If you have a multi-processor machine, dmesg results of both GENERIC.MP
and GENERIC kernels are appreciated.)  The device driver information we get from
this helps us fix existing drivers. Thank you!
</pre></blockquote>

Alternatively, save your dmesg output to a text file

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>(dmesg; sysctl hw.sensors) > ~/dmesg.txt</b>
</pre></blockquote>

and transfer this file to the system you normally use for email.
Since the dmesg output you send in is processed automatically, be sure to
check the following:

<ul>
  <li>Configure your email client to send messages as plain text;
    do not use HTML-formatted email.
  <li>Turn off forced line break features.
  <li>Make sure your email client does not reformat messages into text-flow
    nonsense.
  <li>Do not send the dmesg output as a file attachment.
    Put the dmesg output into the body of the message.
</ul>

<h2 id="bsd.rd">What is <tt>bsd.rd</tt>?</h2>

The <tt>bsd.rd</tt> RAM disk kernel is a live OpenBSD environment that runs
entirely in memory.
It contains the install script and a small number of utilities needed to perform
a complete installation.
These utilities can also be useful for disaster recovery.
The installation media automatically boots into <tt>bsd.rd</tt> and starts
the install script for you.

<p>
If you have a running OpenBSD system, <tt>bsd.rd</tt> is all you need to
reinstall or upgrade to a newer version of OpenBSD without the need for
any removable media.
To do so, simply <a href="#Download">download and verify</a> <tt>bsd.rd</tt>,
place it on an existing filesystem and boot from it.

<p>
Booting from <tt>bsd.rd</tt> on an i386 system:
<blockquote><pre>
Using Drive: 0 Partition: 3
reading boot.....
probing: pc0 com0 com1 apm mem[639k 255M a20=on]
disk: fd0 hd0+
&gt;&gt; OpenBSD/i386 BOOT 3.26
boot&gt; <b>boot hd0a:/bsd.rd</b>

The general method of booting <tt>bsd.rd</tt> is to change your boot kernel
from <tt>/bsd</tt> to <tt>/bsd.rd</tt> through whatever means used on your
platform.

<h2 id="Signify">Problems with signatures</h2>

The verification process consists of fetching the <tt>SHA256.sig</tt> file,
fetching all the install files to the local hard disk, then verifying
their signatures.

<p>
The <tt>installXX.iso</tt> and <tt>installXX.fs</tt> images do not contain
an <tt>SHA256.sig</tt> file, and the installer will complain that it can't
check the signatures.
It is not possible for the installer to verify the sets with these images.
After all, if someone were to make a rogue <tt>installXX.iso</tt> file,
they could certainly change the installer to say the files were legitimate.
Thus, you must <a href="#Download">verify</a> installer downloads separately.

<h2 id="site">Customizing the install process</h2>

<h3>The <tt>siteXX.tgz</tt> file set</h3>

The OpenBSD install and upgrade scripts allow the selection of a user-created
set called <tt>siteXX.tgz</tt>, where <tt>XX</tt> is the release version.
Like the official <a href="#FilesNeeded">file sets</a>, this is a
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tar">tar(1)</a> archive rooted in
<tt>/</tt> and untarred with the <tt>-xzphf</tt> options.
It is installed last, so it can be used to complement and modify the files from
a default install. Furthermore, it is possible to use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/hostname">hostname(1)</a>-dependent
sets named <tt>siteXX-$(hostname -s).tgz</tt>.

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
If you intend to provide installation sets over HTTP, place <tt>siteXX.tgz</tt>
in your source directory and include it in your <tt>index.txt</tt>.
It will then be an option at install time.

<h3>The <tt>install.site</tt> and <tt>upgrade.site</tt> scripts</h3>

If the <tt>siteXX.tgz</tt> file set contains an executable file
<tt>/install.site</tt>, the installer runs it with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/chroot">chroot(8)</a>
based at the freshly installed system's root.
Similarly, the upgrade script runs <tt>/upgrade.site</tt>.
The latter can be placed in the system's root before rebooting for the upgrade.

<p>
Example usages:
<ul>
  <li>Use
  <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rdate">rdate(8)</a> to set the system
    time.
  <li>Do an immediate backup/archive of the new system before you expose it to
    the rest of the world.
  <li>Have a set of arbitrary commands be run after the first boot.
    This will happen if install.site is used to append any such commands to an
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rc.firsttime">rc.firsttime(8)</a>
    file (appending to this file is necessary since the installer itself may
    write to this file).
    At boot time, rc.firsttime is executed once then deleted.
</ul>

<h2 id="Multibooting">Multibooting</h2>

Multibooting is having several operating systems on one computer, and
some means of selecting which OS is to boot.
It is <i>not</i> a trivial task!
If you don't understand what you are doing, you may end up deleting
large amounts of data from your computer.

<p>
New OpenBSD users are <i>strongly</i> encouraged to start with a blank hard
drive on a dedicated machine.

<p>
More information is in the FAQ section on the
<a href="faq14.html#BootAmd64">OpenBSD boot process</a>.
An example showing how to use the installer to set up a custom
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a> configuration for dual
booting with Windows is provided later in this document.

<p>
Preferably use one of the four <i>primary</i> MBR partitions for booting
OpenBSD.
Extended partitions may not work.

<p>
Here are several ways you might configure multibooting:

<h3>Boot loaders</h3>

Some boot loaders OpenBSD users have used successfully include
<a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/">rEFInd</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GRUB</a> as well as the
two dormant projects
<a href="http://gag.sourceforge.net/">GAG</a> and the
<a href="http://www.ranish.com/part/">Ranish Partition Manager</a>.

<h3>GRUB 2</h3>

Assuming OpenBSD is installed on the fourth MBR partition (fdisk partition 3) of
the first hard disk <tt>hd0</tt>, append the following to
<tt>/etc/grub.d/40_custom</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
menuentry "OpenBSD" {
	set root=(hd0,4)
	chainloader +1
}
</pre></blockquote>

Then regenerate the GRUB 2 configuration file, <tt>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</tt>.
On Debian-based distros, you should run <tt>update-grub</tt>.
Otherwise, do

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</b>
</pre></blockquote>

See the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Invoking-grub_002dmkconfig">
GRUB 2 manual</a> or
<a href="http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=update-grub2&sektion=8">
update-grub2(8)</a>
for more information.

<h3>Setting active partitions</h3>

Set the active partition in whatever OS you are currently using to be the one
you want to boot by default when you next boot.
Virtually every OS offers a program to do this.
OpenBSD's is <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a>,
and similarly named programs are in many other operating systems.
Also see the section on <a href="faq14.html#fdisk">using OpenBSD's fdisk</a>.

<h3>Bootable flash drive</h3>

Make a <a href="#MkFlash">bootable flash drive</a>.
On that drive create an <tt>/etc/boot.conf</tt> file with the contents:

<blockquote><pre>
   boot hd0a:/bsd
</pre></blockquote>

This line instructs
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/i386/boot">boot(8)</a>
to load the system from hard drive 0,
<a href="faq14.html#disklabel">disklabel(8) partition</a> <tt>a</tt> and run the
kernel file <tt>/bsd</tt>.

<p>
Configure your system to boot from the other OS by default.
Booting from the flash drive will load OpenBSD.

<h3>Windows Vista, Windows 7 and 10</h3>

With Vista, Microsoft dropped NTLDR support in favor of their newer Boot
Configuration Data (BCD) store used for controlling the boot
environment.
Microsoft has enhanced BCD since releasing Vista to allow multiple
versions of Windows to be booted through <tt>bcdedit</tt>.
For those who find manual configuration daunting,
<a href="https://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/">EasyBCD</a> provides a GUI
alternative.

<p>
Once OpenBSD's PBR is copied to the Windows system partition, issue
the following command to initialize the needed registry hive.
Use a shell with administrative privileges.
Right click on cmd.exe and select "run as administrator".

<blockquote><pre>
C:\Windows\system32> <b>bcdedit /create /d "OpenBSD/i386" /application bootsector</b>
The entry {0154a872-3d41-11de-bd67-a7060316bbb1} was successfully created.
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>{0154a872-3d41-11de-bd67-a7060316bbb1}</tt> GUID is system-dependent.
Note the value you receive when executing, and copy it into the following
commands:

<blockquote><pre>
C:\Windows\system32> <b>bcdedit /set {0154a872-3d41-11de-bd67-a7060316bbb1} device boot</b>
The operation completed successfully.

C:\Windows\system32> <b>bcdedit /set {0154a872-3d41-11de-bd67-a7060316bbb1} path \openbsd.pbr</b>
The operation completed successfully.
</pre></blockquote>

Windows Vista users are done at this point.
For Windows 7 and 10, finish up with:

<blockquote><pre>
C:\Windows\system32> <b>bcdedit /set {0154a872-3d41-11de-bd67-a7060316bbb1} device partition=c:</b>
The operation completed successfully.

C:\Windows\system32> <b>bcdedit /displayorder {0154a872-3d41-11de-bd67-7060316bbb1} /addlast</b>
The operation completed successfully.
</pre></blockquote>

For more information, consult <tt>bcdedit</tt>'s help by issuing:

<blockquote><pre>
C:\Windows\system32> <b>bcdedit /?</b>
</pre></blockquote>

or by searching Microsoft's documentation and Website.

<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc721886%28WS.10%29.aspx">
Frequently Asked Questions</a> article.

<h3>Time zone issues</h3>

OpenBSD expects the computer's real-time clock to be set to
Universal Coordinated Time.
Some other operating systems expect the real-time clock to be set to local time.
See <a href="faq8.html#TimeZone">this section</a> for more info.

<h3>A custom fdisk layout for dual booting</h3>

Before working with any system that has data you don't wish to lose,
make sure you have a good backup.
If you are adding OpenBSD to an existing system, you will probably need to
create some free space before installing OpenBSD.
In addition to your existing system's native tools,
<a href="http://gparted.org/">gparted</a>
may be useful for deleting or resizing existing partitions.

<p>
A brief introduction to <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a>
is in the section on <a href="faq14.html#fdisk">using OpenBSD's fdisk</a>.

<p>
In this example, we will assume we are starting with a blank 40GB disk
and wish to create a multiboot system, reserving 5GB at the beginning
of the disk for Windows, and the rest for OpenBSD.
The process is very much the same for working around an existing
partition, you just need to skip over the parts where we create the
Windows partition and worry about installing the MBR boot code.

<blockquote><pre>
Available disks are: wd0.
Which one is the root disk? (or 'done') [wd0] <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>
MBR has invalid signature; not showing it.
Use (W)hole disk or (E)dit the MBR? [whole] <b>e</b>

You will now create a single MBR partition to contain your OpenBSD data. This
partition must have an id of 'A6'; must *NOT* overlap other partitions; and
must be marked as the only active partition.  Inside the fdisk command, the
'manual' command describes all the fdisk commands in detail.

Disk: wd0       geometry: 4998/255/63 [80293248 Sectors]

Enter 'help' for information
fdisk: 1>
</pre></blockquote>

In the <tt>fdisk: 1></tt> prompt, the number <tt>1</tt> indicates the first
level of partition tables.
If you were editing an extended partition, it would be <tt>2</tt> or higher.
<p>
First, we will make partition <tt>0</tt> a 5GB Windows partition using NTFS.
Partition <tt>1</tt> will be our OpenBSD partition using the rest of the disk.

<blockquote><pre>
fdisk: 1> <b>edit 0</b>
            Starting         Ending         LBA Info:

Partition id ('0' to disable)  [0 - FF]: [0] (? for help) <b>7</b>
</pre></blockquote>

NTFS has partition id <tt>7</tt> and OpenBSD partition id <tt>a6</tt>.
Consult the help prompt for a full list.

<blockquote><pre>
Do you wish to edit in CHS mode? [n] <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>
offset: [0] <b>64</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The fdisk platforms need a gap before the first partition.
The exact amount will not matter on modern machines, OpenBSD defaults
to 64 sectors.

<blockquote><pre>
size: [0] <b>5g</b>
Rounding to nearest cylinder: 10490381
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>size</tt> is measured in sectors (512 bytes), or the desired capacity
when followed by a <tt>k</tt>, <tt>m</tt>, <tt>g</tt> or <tt>t</tt>.

<p>
We've now created our Windows partition.
Note that this partition is just reserved space on the disk, it isn't formatted.

<p>
Now we create our OpenBSD partition.
Note that the prompt now includes an <tt>*</tt>, this means there are unsaved
changes.

<blockquote><pre>
fdisk:*1> <b>e 1</b>
            Starting         Ending         LBA Info:
 #: id      C   H   S -      C   H   S [       start:        size ]

fdisk:*1>
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>offset</tt> we chose is the offset of the previous partition plus
the size of the partition, in this case, 64+10490381 = 10490445.
Entering <tt>*</tt> for <tt>size</tt> means: use the rest of the disk.

<p>
This disk is not yet bootable.
As it was a brand new disk, the disk's <a href="faq14.html#BootAmd64">MBR</a>
is completely blank.
We install MBR bootcode using the <tt>update</tt> command and flag the OpenBSD
partition as the bootable partition.

<blockquote><pre>

</pre></blockquote>

A checklist of things you want to make sure about before you exit fdisk(8):

<ul>
  <li>Non-overlapping partitions?
  <li>The signature should be <tt>0xAA55</tt>. Otherwise <tt>update</tt>.
  <li>Proper partition flagged bootable with <tt>*</tt> in front of the
    partition <tt>#</tt>?
</ul>

Quit and save current changes:

<blockquote><pre>
fdisk:*1> <b>quit</b>
Writing MBR at offset 0.
</pre></blockquote>

To discard all unwritten changes, use <tt><b>exit</b></tt> instead.
