<h2 id="WhatIs">1.1 - What is OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
The <a href="../index.html">OpenBSD</a> project produces a freely
available, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our
<a href="../goals.html">goals</a> place emphasis on correctness, 
<a href="../security.html">security</a>, standardization, and
<a href="../plat.html">portability</a>. 

<p>
This FAQ specifically covers only the most recent release of OpenBSD.

<h2 id="Platforms">1.2 - On what systems does OpenBSD run?</h2>
<!-- XXXrelease - verify platform list is current -->
<p>
OpenBSD runs on the following platforms:
<ul>
    <li><a href="../alpha.html">alpha</a> - <b>Available on CD</b>
    <li><a href="../amd64.html">amd64</a> - <b>Available on CD</b>

    <li><a href="../vax.html">vax</a> - Download only
    <li><a href="../zaurus.html">zaurus</a> - Download only
</ul>

<p>
<b>Available on CD</b> means the <a href="../orders.html">official CD
set</a> includes that platform and a small selection of useful
<a href="faq15.html">packages</a>.
CD ISO images can be downloaded for most other platforms. These are not
the same as the official CD sets, however. Some platforms also have USB
disk images available.

<p>
More information on OpenBSD platforms can be found on the 
<a href="../plat.html">platforms</a> page.

<p>
People sometimes ask why we support so many "odd" machines.
The short answer is "because we want to."
If enough skilled people (and sometimes "enough" is only one really skilled
person!) wish to maintain support for a platform, it will be
supported.
There are practical benefits to keeping OpenBSD multi-platform: when new
platforms come out, the code tree is relatively free of
portability-breaking bugs and design flaws.
The OpenBSD platforms include 32 bit and 64 bit processors, little and
big endian machines, and many different designs.
And yes, supporting "unusual" platforms has helped produce a
higher-quality code base for more common platforms too.

<h2 id="WhyUse">1.3 - Why might I want to use OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
New users frequently want to know whether OpenBSD is superior to some
other free UNIX-like operating system. That question is largely
unanswerable and is the subject of countless (and useless) religious
debates. Do not, under any circumstances, ask such a question on an
OpenBSD mailing list.

<p>
Below are some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating
system:

<p>
<ul>
   <li>OpenBSD runs on many <a href="../plat.html">different hardware
   platforms</a>.
   <li>OpenBSD is thought of by many security professionals as the
   most <a href="../security.html">secure</a> UNIX-like operating system,
   as a result of a never-ending comprehensive source code
   security audit.
   <li>OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available
   in source form at no charge.
   <li>OpenBSD integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for
   <a href="pf/example1.html">building firewalls</a> and
   <a href="../crypto.html#hardware">private network services</a> in a
   distributed environment.
   <li>OpenBSD benefits from strong ongoing development in many areas,  
   offering opportunities to work with emerging technologies with an
   international community of programmers and end users.
   <li>OpenBSD attempts to minimize the need for customization and 
   tweaking.
   For the vast majority of users, OpenBSD "Just Works" on their
   hardware for their application.
   Not only is tweaking and customizing rarely needed, it is actively
   <a href="faq5.html#Why">discouraged</a>.
</ul>

<p>
However, whether OpenBSD is right for you is a question that only you
can answer.

<h2 id="ReallyFree">1.4 - Is OpenBSD really free?</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD is all free. The binaries are free. The source is free. All
parts of OpenBSD have reasonable copyright terms permitting free
redistribution.  This includes the ability to REUSE most parts of the
OpenBSD source tree, either for personal or commercial purposes. OpenBSD
includes NO further restrictions other than those implied by the
original BSD license.  Software which is written under stricter licenses
cannot be included in the regular distribution of OpenBSD.  This is
intended to safeguard the free use of OpenBSD.  For example, OpenBSD can
be freely used for personal use, for academic use, by government
institutions, by non-profit making organizations and by commercial
organizations.
OpenBSD, or parts of it, can also be freely incorporated into
<a href="../products.html">commercial products</a>.

<p>
People sometimes ask if it bothers us that our free work is put into
commercial products.
The answer is, we would prefer that our good code be <i>widely used</i>
rather than have commercial software vendors reimplement and create badly
coded or incompatible alternative solutions to already solved problems.
For example, it is likely that SSH is a widely used protocol due to
this freedom, much more widely used than if restrictions had been placed
on how people used the OpenSSH code.  If a free SSH solution was not
available for vendors to use (in their multitude of rapidly developed
products), they would have written or purchased some crummy off-the
shelf version instead.

<p>
This isn't to say we would object to <a href="../donations.html">financial
or hardware support</a> in thanks.
In fact, it is stunning how little support of any kind comes from
companies that depend upon OpenBSD (or OpenSSH) for their products, but
there is no requirement of compensation.

<p>
For further reading on other popular licenses read: 
<a href="../policy.html">OpenBSD copyright policy</a>.

<p>
The maintainers of OpenBSD support the project largely from their own
pockets.  This includes the time spent programming for the project,
equipment used to support the many ports, the network resources used to
distribute OpenBSD to you, and the time spent answering questions and
investigating users' bug reports.  The OpenBSD developers are not
independently wealthy and even small contributions of time, equipment,
and resources make a big difference.


<h2 id="Support">1.5 - How can I help support OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
We are greatly indebted to the people and organizations that have
contributed to the OpenBSD project. Some are acknowledged by name
on the <a href="../donations.html">donations page</a>.

<p>
OpenBSD has a constant need for several types of support from the user
community. If you find OpenBSD useful, you are strongly encouraged to
find a way to contribute. If none of the suggestions below are right for
you, feel free to propose an alternative by sending email to 
<a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a>. 

<p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="../orders.html">Buy an OpenBSD CD set</a>. It includes
    the current full release of OpenBSD and is bootable on many
    platforms. It also generates revenue to support the OpenBSD project,
    and reduces the strain on network resources used to deliver the
    distribution via the Internet. This inexpensive three CD set
    includes the full source. Your friends could also use a copy!
    <li><a href="../donations.html">Donate money</a>. The project has a
    constant need for cash to pay for equipment, network connectivity,
    and expenses relating to CD publishing.  Manufacturing CDs requires
    an up-front out-of-pocket investment for the OpenBSD developers,
    without guaranteed return. Send email to
    <a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a> to
    find out how to contribute. Even small donations make a profound
    difference.
    <li><a href="../want.html">Donate equipment and parts</a>. The
    project has a constant need for general and specific hardware. Items
    such as IDE, SCSI, SATA and SAS disks, and various types of RAM are always
    welcome. For other types of hardware such as computer systems and
    motherboards, you should inquire as to current need. Write to
    <a href="mailto:donations@openbsd.org">donations@openbsd.org</a> to
    arrange for shipment.
    <li>Donate your time and skills. Programmers who enjoy writing
    operating systems are naturally always welcome, but there are
    literally dozens of other ways that people can be useful. Follow
    <a href="../mail.html">mailing</a> lists and help answer new-user
    questions.
    <li>Help maintain documentation by submitting new FAQ material (to
    <a href="mailto:misc@openbsd.org">misc@openbsd.org</a>). Form a local
    <a href="../groups.html">user group</a> and get your friends hooked
    on OpenBSD. Make a case to your employer for using OpenBSD at work.
    If you're a student, talk to your professors about using OpenBSD as
    a learning tool for Computer Science or Engineering courses. It's
    also worth mentioning one of the most important ways you should not
    try to "help" the OpenBSD project: do not waste your time engaging
    in operating system flame wars. It does not help the project to find
    new users and can cause substantial harm to important relationships
    that developers have with other developers.
</ul>

<h2 id="WhoMaintains">1.6 - Who maintains OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD is maintained by a development team spread across many different
<a href="../images/map.jpg">countries</a>. The project is coordinated by
Theo de Raadt, located in Canada.

<h2 id="Next">1.7 - When is the next release of OpenBSD?</h2>

The OpenBSD team makes a new release every six months, with target release
dates in May and November.  More information on the development cycle 
can be found <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">here</a>.

<h2 id="Included">1.8 - What is included with OpenBSD?</h2>
OpenBSD is distributed with a number of third-party software products,
including:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.x.org">X.org</a>, the X Window environment,
with local patches. Installed with the <tt>x*.tgz</tt>
<a href="faq4.html#FilesNeeded">install file sets</a>.

<li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a>, the GNU C Compiler.
Installed as part of the <tt>compXX.tgz</tt> file set.

<li><a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>, with patches and
improvements from the OpenBSD team.

<li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>, with patches
and improvements from the OpenBSD team.

<li><a href="http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd">NSD</a> and
<a href="http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound">Unbound</a>,
the authoritative name server and recursive caching resolver.

<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses">ncurses</a>

<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils">binutils</a>,
with patches.

<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/gdb.html">gdb</a>, with
patches.

<li><a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less">less</a>, with
patches. <!-- XXXrelease remove for 5.9 or change to github url -->

</ul>

As can be seen, the OpenBSD team often patches third party products,
typically to improve the security or quality of the code. In some cases,
the user will see no difference in operation. In other cases, there ARE
operational differences which may impact some users.
Keep these enhancements in mind before blindly adding different versions
of the same software. You may get a bigger version number, but a less
secure system.
<p>

Much <a href="../innovations.html">home-grown software</a> is also included,
and additional applications can be added through the OpenBSD
<a href="faq15.html">packages and ports</a> system. 

<h2 id="WhatsNew">1.9 - What is new in OpenBSD 5.8?</h2>
<!-- XXXrelease - do we really need this here? seems redundant -->

The complete list of changes made to OpenBSD 5.7 to create OpenBSD 5.8
can be found on <a href="../plus58.html">plus58.html</a>, and highlights
on the <a href="../58.html">OpenBSD 5.8 information page</a>, however
here are a few changes the OpenBSD team anticipate will require or
warrant some special note to people upgrading or installing OpenBSD 5.8
who are familiar with older versions:

<ul>
<li><b>sudo removed</b> in favor of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=doas&amp;sektion=1">doas(1)</a>.
sudo is available as a package if needed.
More info on doas(1) can be found <a href="faq10.html#doas">here</a>.

<li><b>Root logins via SSH are actively discouraged.</b>
Default is to prohibit root login via SSH.

<li><b>SSHv1 disabled at compile time.</b>
You shouldn't be using this anyway.
Some other insecure protocols are disabled at runtime (i.e., config file
options can reactivate), but some old clients may notice.
This is a clue you should upgrade your client.

<li><b><a href="faq6.html#OpenNTPD">OpenNTPD</a> active by default on
new installs</b>, and will by default use pool.ntp.org.
You can reconfigure it by editing
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ntpd.conf&amp;sektion=5"><tt>/etc/ntpd.conf</tt>(5)</a>
or disable it in <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt>.


</ul>

<h2 id="Desktop">1.10 - Can I use OpenBSD as a desktop system?</h2>
This question is often asked in exactly this manner, with no
explanation of what "desktop" requirements entail.
The only person who can answer that question is you, as it depends on
what your needs and expectations are.

<p>
While OpenBSD has a great reputation as a "server" operating system, it
can be (and is) used on the desktop.
Many "desktop" applications are available through
<a href="faq15.html">packages and ports</a>.
As with all operating system decisions, the question is: can it do the
job you desire in the way you wish?
You must answer this question for yourself.

<p>
It might be worth noting that a large amount of OpenBSD development is
done on laptops running OpenBSD.

<h2 id="HowAbout">1.11 - Why is/isn't <i>ProductX</i> included?</h2>

People often ask why a particular product is or isn't included with
OpenBSD.
The answer is based on two things: the wishes of the developers and
compatibility with the <a href="../goals.html">goals</a> of the
project.
A product will not be included simply because it is "nifty" -- it must
also be "free" for use, distribution and modification by our standards.
A product must also be stable and secure -- a bigger version number does
not always mean a better product.

<p>
Licensing is often the biggest problem: we want OpenBSD to remain usable
by any person anywhere in the world for any purpose.

<p>
Another major consideration is the wishes of the developers.
The OpenBSD developers are the ultimate judges of what does and doesn't
go into the project.
Just because an application is "good" doesn't mean the OpenBSD project
wishes to devote the resources needed to maintaining it, or that 
they will share other's enthusiasm about its place in OpenBSD.

<p>
Some commonly asked questions about third-party products:
<ul>
<li><i>Why is a web server included? It isn't needed by many people!</i><br> 
Because the developers want it.
<p>
<li><i>Why isn't bzip2 included instead of gzip?</i><br>
Performance is horrible, and benefit is minimal.
Impact on slower platforms would be unacceptable.
<p>
<li><i>Why isn't there a graphical or
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=curses&amp;sektion=3">curses(3)</a>
based installer?</i><br>
For a number of reasons, including the goal of keeping the installation
boot media able to be a single floppy disk, the fact that one installer
can be used on all platforms in all configurations, and the fact that
after the second or third OpenBSD install, most users find the OpenBSD
installation system among the fastest and easiest installers of any OS.
Most developers and users greatly prefer the speed, power, and ease of
use of the current installer to any of the more "colorful" or "pretty"
installers on some other platforms.
<p>
<li><i>Will ZFS be added to OpenBSD?</i><br>
Not unless someone can convince Oracle to change the license for it to
something compatible with OpenBSD <a href="../policy.html">policy</a>.

</ul>

In most cases, these topics have been discussed in painful detail on
the <a href="faq2.html#MailLists">mailing lists</a>. Please see the
archives if you need more information.

<p>
Of course, if you wish to use one of these packages and your use is
compatible with the license of the products, no one will stop you (that
wouldn't be very free if we tried, would it?).
However, your needs may change -- you may not want to develop a
"Killer Application" that you can't sell, distribute, or get rich from
because you incorporated non-free software into it.
