<i>Note: Upgrades are only supported from one release to the release
immediately following it.
Do not skip releases.
If you got lucky skipping releases in the past, you may not this time.</i>

<p><i>
It is highly recommended that you read through and fully understand
this process before attempting it.
If you are doing it on a critical or physically remote machine, it is
recommended that you test this process on an identical, local system to
verify its success before attempting on a critical or remote computer.

<h2 id="before">Before upgrading: things to think about and be aware of</h2>
This is <i>not</i> a complete list of the changes that took place
between 5.5 and 5.6, but rather some of the important things that will
impact users in the upgrade process.
For a more complete list of changes, see
<a href="../plus56.html">plus56.html</a> and the CVS change logs.

<ul>
<li id="signed"><b>Releases signed</b><br>
OpenBSD releases are now cryptographically signed using the new
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/signify.1">signify(1)</a>
utility.
However, the install media with all file sets (<tt>install56.fs</tt>,
<tt>install56.iso</tt>) cannot self-check, nor should they.
After all, if someone has delivered a compromised install set to you,
they would probably have set it to say "all is well."
<p>
Instead, you should <a href="faq4.html#Download">verify your install media
file</a> separately, then install without further concern.

<p>
<li id="NoFTP"><b>FTP is no longer an install option</b><br>
The installer will now use HTTP as its file transfer protocol.
All public mirrors will support this, of course, but if you have a local
mirror, make sure it can serve files via HTTP.
<p>

<li id="ToPorts"><b>Kerberos, Apache httpd, lynx, rmail, uucpd have been removed from
base</b><br>
Though these applications are all available as a packages if their use
is required.

<p>

<li id="OtherChanges"><b>Other changes</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>rc.conf.local is no longer a shell script. Variables
	(notably pkg_scripts) must now be on single lines.
	<li>pf.conf: altq backwards compatibility has been removed.
	Remove "oldqueue" entries from pf.conf(5) if present, otherwise
	PF rules will not be loaded.
	<li>MACs, modes and ciphers permitted by sshd have been tightened.
	Some clients (notably Paramiko and old versions of PuTTY) may not
	be able connect after upgrade without sshd_config changes.
	<li>IPv6 autoconfiguration overhaul.
	Link-local addresses are no longer configured on every network
	interface by default - an explicit step to enable an IPv6 address
	must be taken in order to enable this.
	Configuring a static IPv6 address or using "rtsol" automatically
	adds the necessary link-local address so in many cases no changes
	are needed, but IPv6 pppoe(4) users must add "inet6 eui64" to
	their /etc/hostname.pppoe* files.
	<li>/etc/rc and /etc/rc.conf have moved from etc*.tgz to base56.tgz
	so will be replaced at upgrade time. If you have made local changes
	to these files, save a copy before upgrading.
</ul>

<p>

<li id="headsup"><b>Advanced notice: Big changes coming for future releases!</b><br>
There are some big changes coming up in OpenBSD 5.7 (NOT 5.6!)
that you may wish to think about and plan for.
<ul>
<li>OpenBSD's version of nginx will be removed from base
in favor of an internally developed httpd server in 5.7.
nginx will be available as a <a href="faq15.html">package</a> for
those with applications dependent upon it.
<li>BIND (named) will be removed from base in 5.7 in favor of
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/nsd.8">nsd(8)</a>
(authoritative DNS) and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/unbound.8">unbound(8)</a>
(recursive resolver).
Packages will exist for BIND.
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="upgrade">The upgrade process</h2>

<h3>Upgrading by install kernel</h3>
If you have access to the system's console, the easiest and safest way
to upgrade is to boot from the install kernel by boot media or
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> and follow the upgrade steps,
which are very similar to the <a href="faq4.html">install process</a>.

<p>
Afterwards, complete the upgrade by following the <a href="#final">final
steps</a> as detailed below.

<p>
One easy way to boot from the install kernel is to place the 5.6 version
of <i>bsd.rd</i> in the root of your boot drive, then instruct the boot loader
to boot using this new <i>bsd.rd</i> file.
On amd64 and i386, you do this by entering "<tt>boot bsd.rd</tt>" at the
initial <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt.

<h3>Upgrading without install kernel</h3>
<i>This is NOT the recommended process.  Use the install kernel method
if at all possible!</i>

<p>
Sometimes, one needs to do an upgrade of a machine when one can't easily
use the normal upgrade process.
The most common case is when the machine is in a remote location and you
don't have easy access to the system console.
One can usually do this by carefully following this process:

<ul>
<li><b>Place install files in a "good" location</b>.
Make sure you have sufficient space!
Running out of space on a remote upgrade could be...unfortunate.
Note that using softdeps can exaggerate the situation as deleted and
overwritten files do not release their space immediately.
Having at least 200MB free on /usr would be recommended.

<p>
<li><b>Become root with ksh(1):</b>
While using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sudo.8">sudo(8)</a>
before each command is generally a good practice, the sudo(8) command
will be broken by the last steps, so you should be root before starting
this process.
Also, the use of the OpenBSD
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a>
shell is assumed.

<p>
<li><b>Stop and/or disable any appropriate applications:</b>
During this process, all the userland applications will be replaced but
may not be runnable, and strange things may happen as a result.
You may also have issues with DNS resolution during the first reboot, so
PF rules and NFS mounts dependent upon DNS may cause boot-up problems.
There may be other applications which you wish to keep from running
immediately after the upgrade, stop and disable them as well.

<p>
<li><b>Install new boot blocks:</b>
This should actually be done at the end of any upgrade, but we will
assume this has been neglected.
Failure to do this may break serial console or other things, depending
on platform.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>installboot -v sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>Install new kernel(s):</b>
<ul>
<li>If you are using the multiprocessor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd.mp /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd /</b>
<b>cp bsd /bsd.sp</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>If using a single processor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd bsd.mp /</b>
</pre></blockquote>
(note: you will get a harmless error message if your platform doesn't
have a bsd.mp):

</ul>

<p>
Note the extra steps for copying over the primary kernel: those are done
to ensure that there is always a valid copy of the kernel on the disk
that the system can boot from should there be a really badly timed power
outage or system crash.

<p>
<li><b>Save a copy of reboot(8), install new userland applications.</b>
You are still running the old kernel, it is possible the new reboot
command will not run on the old kernel, so we will start by saving a
copy of the old reboot command.
<i>Do NOT install <tt>etc56.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc56.tgz</tt> now, because
that will overwrite your current configuration files!</i>
Note that we are installing base56.tgz LAST, because it will include a new
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tar.1">tar(1)</a>
utility, which may or may not run on the old kernel.
We reboot immediately, as the system is probably barely runnable after
the unpacking of all the new files.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cp /sbin/reboot /sbin/oreboot</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xserv56.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xfont56.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xshare56.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xbase56.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf game56.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf comp56.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf man56.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf base56.tgz</b> # Install last!
<b>/sbin/oreboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Not all file sets will need to be installed for all applications,
however if you installed a file set originally, you should certainly
upgrade it with the new file set now.

<p>
Again, the files in <tt>/etc</tt> are handled separately below, so
<tt>etc56.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc56.tgz</tt> are NOT unpacked here.

<p>
<li><b>After reboot completes, upgrade <tt>/dev</tt>.</b>
The new
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-5.6/i386/MAKEDEV">MAKEDEV</a>
file was copied to /dev by the installation of
<tt>base56.tgz</tt>, so you simply need to do the following:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /dev</b>
<b>./MAKEDEV all</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li><b>Install the upgraded boot loader:</b>
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a>
has been "unified" across platforms, so a common (and simplified!) syntax
can be used:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>installboot -v sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>
assuming "sd0" is your boot disk.

</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="final">Final steps</h2>

Whether you upgrade by using an install kernel and doing a formal
"upgrade" process, or do a "in-place" binary upgrade, you need to do a
few final steps to complete the upgrade.

<p>
<h3 id="sysmerge">1. Merging changed files via sysmerge(8)</h3>

The
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>
utility will compare the files that are actually on your system with
those that would be installed in a fresh install, and assist you in
merging the changes into your system.
There are no assumptions made about
what is actually on your system, so you can use sysmerge(8) to move
between more arbitrary <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">points in the
development process</a>, such as from an earlier <i>5.5-current</i> to
<i>5.6-release</i> or from one <i>-current</i> to a later one.
Sysmerge(8) compares the current files on your system with the files
that would have been installed with a new install, and what would have
been there from the last run of sysmerge.
Usually, it can figure out what to do to update your files.
If it has difficulty, it will give you the option of keeping the old
file, installing the new file, or assisting you in the manual merging of
the old and new files, using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff</a>.

<p>
Please read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>
manual page before using it on your system.
You are also advised to read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/diff.1">diff(1)</a>,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff(1)</a>
and even review
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/more.1">more(1)</a>
manual pages before continuing.
A wide terminal window (i.e., significantly more than 80 characters), if
available, will make sdiff(1) easier to use.

<p>
Assuming the <tt>SHA256.sig</tt>, <tt>etc56.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc56.tgz</tt> files exists in
your ${RELEASEPATH} (which can be an http:// URL!), run it with:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>sysmerge -s ${RELEASEPATH}/etc56.tgz -x ${RELEASEPATH}/xetc56.tgz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

(if you don't have SHA256.sig available, use the -S option to skip the
signature check)

For the files sysmerge(8) can't resolve on its own, it will show you a
unified
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/diff.1">diff(1)</a>,
run through your favorite $PAGER (i.e.,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/more.1">more(1)</a>)
and ask you if you wish to:
<blockquote><pre>
  Use 'd' to delete the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'i' to install the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'm' to merge the temporary and installed versions
  Use 'v' to view the diff results again

  Default is to leave the temporary file to deal with by hand
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you wish to retain your existing file, delete the temporary file.
If you wish to replace your existing file with the new version, install the
temporary file.
If you wish to merge the two together, choosing 'm' will put you into
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff(1)</a>,
where you can manually merge the file.
The default is to come back and deal with the file later, manually.

<p>
Sysmerge(8) saves all your replaced files into a temporary directory,
similar to <tt>/var/tmp/sysmerge.24959/backups</tt>, so if you accidentally
clobber something that was probably not such a good idea, you have a chance
to recover it. Note that
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/daily.8">daily(8)</a>
cleans old files from this directory, but it will survive a reboot.


<h3 id="RmFiles">2. Files to delete and move</h3>
Some files should be deleted from your system, and others
must be moved or updated.
Note that some of these may not exist on all systems; that's ok.
The list of commands to run is broken up into modest size blocks; some
slower hardware will have trouble keeping up with one large copy/paste.

The following files are associated with httpd(8) and can be deleted in some
cases, but may have been replaced with user content or configuration.
<b>Warning: On systems which currently or have previously used any http daemon,
care must be taken and files analyzed case by case to avoid accidental deletion
of user content or important configuration files.</b>
In particular, users moving to package apache-httpd-openbsd will want to
keep many of these files.

Sendmail is now deprecated in the base OS, and will move to packages in 5.7.
The standard MTA is now
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>.
To switch to smtpd, make sure that no important mail is waiting in Sendmail's
queue, remove the sendmail crontab entry from root's crontab, edit
<tt>/etc/mailer.conf</tt> to make sure only smtpd is run, and run newaliases.


<p>
<h3 id="Pkgup">3. Upgrading packages</h3>
If you installed any packages on your system, you should upgrade them
after completing the upgrade of the base system.
Be aware, however, many packages will require further setup before
and/or after upgrading the package.
Check with the application's upgrade guide for details.

<p>
The following packages are known to have significant upgrade issues that
will impact users.
The fact that a package is not on this list doesn't mean it will have a
trivial upgrade.
You must do some homework on the applications YOU use.

<ul>
<li><b>unbound(8) moved to the base OS.</b><br>
If the package is installed, remove it before upgrading to avoid a
conflict in /etc/rc.d/unbound, and edit rc.conf.local to remove "unbound"
from "pkg_scripts=..." lines, and add "unbound_flags=" instead.
<blockquote><pre>
pkg_delete unbound
vi /etc/rc.conf.local
</pre></blockquote>

<li><b>Roundcube configuration files have been rearranged.</b><br>
If upgrading an existing system you will need to migrate your settings
from old config files (db.inc.php and main.inc.php) to the new file
(config.inc.php).

<li><b>Bacula has been split into subpackages for different database
backends.</b><br>
Users of the recommended PostgreSQL backend won't need to make any changes;
users of other backends should run uninstall Bacula and then add it again
with pkg_add, selecting the preferred database backend from the list offered.

<li><b>Increased file descriptor use in KDE4</b><br>
Some KDE4 components (kded4, Akonadi, Digikam database and others) now
monitor directories for changes via kqueue(2).
This saves CPU time, but kqueue requires one file descriptor per
monitored file.
Thus limits for system (<tt>kern.maxfiles</tt> sysctl) and/or process
(<tt>openfiles</tt> in login.conf(5)) need to be adjusted:
<ul>
<li>about 3500 descriptors will be always eaten by kded4;
<li>one file descriptor per message in each local maildir used by Akonadi;
<li>one file descriptor per picture in Digikam database;
<li>one file descriptor per file in each folder view window;
<li>one file descriptor per each folder being monitored itself;
<li>and so on.
</ul>

<li><b>apache-httpd-openbsd and apache-httpd rc scripts renamed</b><br>
The rc scripts of the apache-httpd-openbsd and apache-httpd packages
have been renamed.
In rc.conf.local, replace "httpd" with "apache" in pkg_scripts, and
replace "httpd_flags" with "apache_flags" (likewise for httpd2 and apache2).
You may also need to adapt cronjobs or scripts if they use the rc script
to restart Apache (e.g. for log rotation).<br>
Upgrading the apache-httpd-openbsd package will cause a conflict.
To fix, reinstate the rc script of base httpd, and remove the partial
package:
<pre>
        mv -i /etc/rc.d/httpd.* /etc/rc.d/httpd
        pkg_delete partial-apache-httpd-openbsd
</pre>

<li><b>nagios-plugins replaced with monitoring-plugins</b><br>
The various nagios-plugins packages have been
<a href="https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/news/new-project-name.html">renamed</a>
to monitoring-plugins. Updates from a previous version with "pkg_add -u"
will pick up the replacements, but if making a clean installation you will
need to use the new names.


</ul>

<p>
The package tools support in-place updating using <tt>pkg_add -u</tt>.
For instance, to update all your packages, make sure <tt>PKG_PATH</tt> is
pointing to the 5.6 packages directory on your CD or nearest FTP mirror,
and use something like

<blockquote><pre>
<b>pkg_add -u</b>
</pre></blockquote>

where the <tt>-u</tt> indicates update mode;
pkg_add will prompt you for input when it encounters
some ambiguity.
Read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-5.6/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a>
manual page and the <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">package management</a>
chapter of the FAQ for more information.
