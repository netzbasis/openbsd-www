<h2 id="intro">Disks and partitions</h2>

The details of setting up disks in OpenBSD vary between
<a href="../plat.html">platforms</a>, so you should read the instructions in
your platform's <tt>INSTALL.&lt;arch&gt;</tt> file.

<h3>Drive identification</h3>

On most platforms, OpenBSD handles mass storage with two drivers:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wd">wd(4)</a>:
    IDE-like disks: IDE, SATA, MFM or ESDI disks, or a flash device, attached to
    a <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wdc">wdc(4)</a> or a
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pciide">pciide(4)</a> interface.
  <li><a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sd">sd(4)</a>:
    SCSI-like disks: Devices that utilize SCSI commands, USB disks, SATA disks
    attached to an <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ahci">ahci(4)</a> interface,
    and disk arrays attached to a RAID controller.
</ul>

The devices are numbered by the order in which they are detected at boot time,
starting at zero.
So, the first IDE-like disk will be <tt>wd0</tt> and the third SCSI-like disk
will be <tt>sd2</tt>.
Removing or adding a disk may impact the identity of other drives on the system.
Note that OpenBSD will not necessarily number drives in the same order as your
boot ROM.

<h3>Partitions and filesystems</h3>

The term "partition" can mean two different things in OpenBSD:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a> partitions, also
    called filesystem partitions.
  <li>
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a> partitions, sometimes
    called Master Boot Record (MBR) partitions.
</ul>

All OpenBSD platforms use the disklabel program as the primary way to manage
filesystem partitions.
On the platforms that use fdisk, one MBR partition is used to hold all of the
OpenBSD filesystems.
This partition can be sliced into 16 disklabel partitions, labeled <tt>a</tt>
through <tt>p</tt>.

<p>
Thus, a device name plus a disklabel identify an OpenBSD filesystem.
For example, the identifier <tt>sd2a</tt> refers to the filesystem on the
<tt>a</tt> partition of the third <tt>sd</tt> device.
Its device files would be <tt>/dev/sd2a</tt> for the block device and
<tt>/dev/rsd2a</tt> for the raw (character) device.
Remembering whether a rarely used command needs a block or a character device
is difficult.
Therefore, many commands make use of the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/opendev">opendev(3)</a> function, which
automatically expands <tt>sd0</tt> to <tt>/dev/rsd0c</tt> or <tt>wd0a</tt> to
<tt>/dev/wd0a</tt>, as appropriate.

<p>
A few labels are special:

<ul>
  <li><tt>a</tt>:
    The boot disk's <tt>a</tt> partition is your root partition.
  <li><tt>b</tt>:
    The boot disk's <tt>b</tt> partition is usually a swap partition.
  <li><tt>c</tt>:
    The <tt>c</tt> partition is always the entire disk.
</ul>

<h3 id="DUID">Disklabel Unique Identifiers</h3>

Disks can also be identified by Disklabel Unique Identifiers (DUIDs), a
16 hex digit number, managed by the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/diskmap">diskmap(4)</a> device.
This number is a random number generated when a disklabel is first created.
You can specify partitions on the disk by appending a period and the partition
letter.
For example, <tt>f18e359c8fa2522b.d</tt> is the <tt>d</tt> partition of the disk
<tt>f18e359c8fa2522b</tt> and will always refer to the same chunk of storage, no
matter what order the devices attached to the system, or what kind of interface
it is attached to.
If you put data on <tt>wd2d</tt>, then later remove <tt>wd1</tt> from the system
and reboot, your data is now on <tt>wd1d</tt>, as your old <tt>wd2</tt> is now
<tt>wd1</tt>.
However, a drive's DUID won't change after boot.

<h2 id="fdisk">Using fdisk</h2>

The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a> utility is used on some
platforms (i386, amd64 and macppc) to create a partition recognized by the
system boot ROM.
Normally, only one OpenBSD fdisk partition will be placed on a disk and that
partition will then be subdivided into disklabel partitions.

<p>
View your partition table with:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk sd0</b>
Disk: sd0       geometry: 553/255/63 [8883945 Sectors]
Offset: 0       Signature: 0xAA55
         Starting       Ending       LBA Info:
 #: id    C   H  S -    C   H  S [       start:      size   ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0: 12    0   1  1 -    2 254 63 [          63:       48132 ] Compaq Diag.
 1: 00    0   0  0 -    0   0  0 [           0:           0 ] unused
 2: 00    0   0  0 -    0   0  0 [           0:           0 ] unused
*3: A6    3   0  1 -  552 254 63 [       48195:     8835750 ] OpenBSD
</pre></blockquote>

Here, the OpenBSD partition (id <tt>A6</tt>) is marked with a <tt>*</tt> to
indicate that it is the bootable partition.

<p>
A totally blank disk will need to have the master boot record's boot code
written to the disk before it can boot.
Normally, all you need to do is:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -iy sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Alternatively, use the <tt>reinit</tt> or <tt>update</tt> commands in
interactive mode.

<p>
The <tt>-e</tt> flag starts interactive editing mode:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -e sd0</b>
Enter 'help' for information
fdisk: 1>
</pre></blockquote>

Beware that <tt>q</tt> saves changes and exits the program, while <tt>x</tt>
exits without saving.
This is the opposite of what many people are now used to in other environments.
Note also that fdisk does not warn before saving the changes.

<p>
If your system has a maintenance or diagnostic partition, it is recommended that
you leave it in place or install it <b>before</b> installing OpenBSD.

<h2 id="disklabel">What are disk labels?</h2>

Disk labels are used to manage OpenBSD filesystem partitions.
They contain certain details about your disk, such as drive geometry and
filesystem information, as described in depth in the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.5">disklabel(5)</a> man page.
Use the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a> command
to edit the labels.

<p>
This can help overcome some architectures' disk partitioning limitations.
For example, on i386, there are only four primary MBR partitions available.
With disk labels, one of these primary partitions contains all your OpenBSD
partitions, while the other three are still available for other operating
systems.

<p>
On platforms using fdisk, you should leave the first logical track unused, both
in disklabel and in fdisk.
For this reason, the default is to start the first partition at block 64.

<p>
Don't put swap at the very beginning of your disk on sparc64.
While Solaris often did that, OpenBSD requires the boot partition to be at the
beginning of the disk.

<h3>Recovering partitions after deleting the disklabel</h3>

If you have a damaged partition table, there are various things you can attempt
to do to recover it.

<p>
A copy of the disklabel for each disk is saved in <tt>/var/backups</tt> as part
of the daily system maintenance.
Assuming you still have the <tt>/var</tt> partition, you can simply read the
output, and put it back into disklabel with the <tt>-R</tt> flag.

<p>
In the event that you can no longer see that partition, there are two options:
Fix enough of the disk so you can see it, or fix enough of the disk so that you
can get your data off.
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/scan_ffs">scan_ffs(8)</a> utility will look
through a disk to find partitions.
You can use the information it finds to recreate the disklabel.
If you just want <tt>/var</tt> back, you can recreate the partition for
<tt>/var</tt>, then recover the backed up label and add the rest from that.
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a> utility will
both update the kernel's understanding of the disklabel and attempt to write
the label to disk.
Therefore, even if the area of the disk containing the disklabel is unreadable,
you will be able to mount until the next reboot.

<h2 id="BootAmd64">The amd64 boot process</h2>

Details on the amd64 bootstrapping procedure are given in the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/boot_amd64">boot_amd64(8)</a> man page.
The boot process is as follows:

<ol>
  <li>Master Boot Record (MBR) and GUID Partition Table (GPT).
    The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a> man page contains
    the details.
  <li>Partition Boot Record (PBR).
    The first 512 bytes of the boot disk's OpenBSD partition contain the first
    stage boot loader <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/biosboot">biosboot(8)</a>.
    It is installed by the
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/installboot">installboot(8)</a> utility.
  <li>Second stage boot loader <tt>/boot</tt>.
    The PBR loads the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/boot">boot(8)</a> program
    which has the task of locating and loading the kernel.
</ol>

So, the very start of the boot process could look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
Using drive 0, partition 3.                      <b>&lt;- MBR</b>
Loading......                                    <b>&lt;- PBR</b>

</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="SoftUpdates">Soft updates</h2>

Soft updates are based on an idea proposed by
<a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/papers/CSE-TR-254-95/">Greg Ganger
and Yale Patt</a> and developed for FreeBSD by
<a href="http://www.mckusick.com/softdep/">Kirk McKusick</a>.
Soft updates imposes a partial ordering on the buffer cache
operations which permits the requirement for synchronous writing of
directory entries to be removed from the FFS code.
A large increase is seen in diskwriting performance as a result.

<p>
Enabling soft updates must be done with a mount-time option.
When mounting a partition with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount">mount(8)</a>
utility, you can specify that you wish to have soft updates enabled on
that partition.
Below is a sample
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fstab">fstab(5)</a>
entry that has one partition <tt>sd0a</tt> that we wish to have mounted
with soft updates.

<blockquote><pre>
/dev/sd0a / ffs rw,softdep 1 1
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="altroot">Duplicating your root partition: <tt>/altroot</tt></h2>

OpenBSD provides an <tt>/altroot</tt> facility in the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/daily">daily(8)</a>
scripts.
If the environment variable <tt>ROOTBACKUP=1</tt> is set in either
<tt>/etc/daily.local</tt> or root's
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/crontab.5">crontab(5)</a>,
and a partition is specified in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fstab">fstab(5)</a>
as mounting to <tt>/altroot</tt> with the mount options of <tt>xx</tt>, every
night the entire contents of the root partition will be duplicated to the
<tt>/altroot</tt> partition.

<p>
Assuming you want to back up your root partition to the partition specified
by the <a href="faq14.html#DUID">DUID</a> <tt>bfb4775bb8397569.a</tt>,
add the following to <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>

<blockquote><pre>
bfb4775bb8397569.a /altroot ffs xx 0 0
</pre></blockquote>

and set the appropriate environment variable in <tt>/etc/daily.local</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo ROOTBACKUP=1 >>/etc/daily.local</b>
</pre></blockquote>

As the <tt>/altroot</tt> process will capture your <tt>/etc</tt> directory, this
will make sure any configuration changes there are updated daily.
This is a "disk image" copy done with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dd">dd(1)</a>
not a file-by-file copy, so your <tt>/altroot</tt> partition should be at least
the same size as your root partition.
Generally, you will want your <tt>/altroot</tt> partition to be on a different
disk that has been configured to be fully bootable should the primary
disk fail.

<h2 id="foreignfs">Can I access data on filesystems other than FFS?</h2>

Yes.
Start with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount">mount(8)</a>
manual which contains examples explaining how to mount some of the
most commonly used filesystems.
A partial list of
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=mount_&amp;sec=8&amp;apropos=1">
supported filesystems</a>
and related commands can be obtained with

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>man -k -s 8 mount</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Note that support may be limited to read-only operation.

<h2 id="MountImage">Mounting disk images</h2>

To mount a disk image in OpenBSD you must configure a
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/vnd">vnd(4)</a>
device.
For example, if you have an ISO image located at <tt>/tmp/ISO.image</tt>,
you would take the following steps to mount the image.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>vnconfig vnd0 /tmp/ISO.image</b>
# <b>mount -t cd9660 /dev/vnd0c /mnt</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Since this is an ISO 9660 image, as used by CDs and DVDs, you must specify
type of <tt>cd9660</tt> when mounting it.

<p>
To unmount the image and unconfigure the vnd(4) device, do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>umount /mnt</b>
# <b>vnconfig -u vnd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

For more information, refer to
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/vnconfig">vnconfig(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount">mount(8)</a>.

<h2 id="NegSpace">Why does df tell me I have over 100% of my disk used?</h2>

People are sometimes surprised to find they have negative available disk space,
or more than 100% of a filesystem in use, as shown by
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/df">df(1)</a>.

<p>
When a filesystem is created with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/newfs">newfs(8)</a>,
some of the available space is held in reserve from normal users.
This provides a margin of error when you accidentally fill the disk, and
helps keep disk fragmentation to a minimum.
Default for this is 5% of the disk capacity, so if the root user has
been carelessly filling the disk, you may see up to 105% of the
available capacity in use.

<p>
If the 5% value is not appropriate for you, you can change it with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tunefs">tunefs(8)</a>
command.

<h2 id="softraid">RAID and disk encryption</h2>

The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/softraid">softraid(4)</a> subsystem works
by emulating a <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/scsibus">scsibus(4)</a> with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sd">sd(4)</a> devices made by combining a number
of OpenBSD <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a>
partitions into a virtual disk with the desired RAID level.
This virtual disk is treated as any other disk, first partitioned with
<a href="#fdisk">fdisk</a> (on fdisk platforms) and then
<a href="#disklabel">disklabels</a> are created as usual.
Note that only RAID0, RAID1, RAID5 and crypto are fully supported at the moment.

<h3 id="softraidDI">Installing to a mirror</h3>

This section covers installing OpenBSD to a mirrored pair of hard drives,
and assumes familiarity with the <a href="faq4.html">installation process</a>.
Disk setup may vary from platform to platform, and
<b>booting from softraid devices isn't supported on all of them</b>.
It's currently only possible to boot from RAID1 and crypto volumes
on i386, amd64 and sparc64.

<p>
Before using the install script, you will drop to a shell and set up a
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/softraid">softraid(4)</a> device.

<p>
The install kernel only has the <tt>/dev</tt> entries for one
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wd">wd(4)</a> device and one
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sd">sd(4)</a> device on boot, so you will need
to manually create more disk devices if your desired softraid setup requires
them.
For example, if you need to support a second and third
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sd">sd(4)</a> device for a mirrored setup, you
could do the following from the shell prompt:

<blockquote><pre>
Welcome to the OpenBSD/amd64 X.X installation program.
(I)nstall, (U)pgrade, (A)utoinstall or (S)hell? <b>s</b>
# <b>cd /dev</b>
# <b>sh MAKEDEV sd1 sd2</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You now have full support for the <tt>sd0</tt>, the <tt>sd1</tt> and
<tt>sd2</tt> devices.

<p>
Next, we'll initialize the disks with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a> and create RAID partitions
with <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a>.

<p>
If you're booting from MBR, do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -iy sd0</b>
# <b>fdisk -iy sd1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If you use GPT for UEFI booting, do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -iy -g -b 960 sd0</b>
# <b>fdisk -iy -g -b 960 sd1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Create the partition layout on the first device:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>disklabel -E sd0</b>
Label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)
> <b>a a</b>
offset: [64]
size: [39825135] <b>*</b>
FS type: [4.2BSD] <b>RAID</b>
> <b>w</b>
> <b>q</b>
No label changes.
</pre></blockquote>

Copy the partition layout to the second device:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>disklabel sd0 > layout</b>
# <b>disklabel -R sd1 layout</b>
# <b>rm layout</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Assemble the mirror with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/bioctl">bioctl(8)</a> command:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl -c 1 -l sd0a,sd1a softraid0</b>
scsibus1 at softraid0: 1 targets
sd2 at scsibus2 targ 0 lun 0: &lt;OPENBSD, SR RAID 1, 005&gt; SCSI2 0/direct fixed
sd2: 10244MB, 512 bytes/sec, 20980362 sec total
</pre></blockquote>

This shows that we now have a new SCSI bus and a new disk, <tt>sd2</tt>.
This volume will be automatically detected and assembled when the system boots.

<p>
Even if you create multiple RAID arrays, the device name will always be
<tt>softraid0</tt>.
There won't be a <tt>softraid1</tt> or anything else.

<p>
Because the new device probably has a lot of garbage where you expect
a master boot record and disklabel, zeroing the first chunk of it is
highly recommended.
Be <b>very careful</b> with this command; issuing it on the wrong device
could lead to a very bad day.
This assumes that the new softraid device was created as <tt>sd2</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd2c bs=1m count=1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You are now ready to install OpenBSD on your system.
Perform the install as normal by invoking "install" or "exit" at the boot
media console.
Create all the partitions on your new softraid disk (<tt>sd2</tt> in our
example here) that should be there, rather than on <tt>sd0</tt> or <tt>sd1</tt>
(the non-RAID disks).

<p>
To check on the status of your mirror, issue the following command:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl sd2</b>
</pre></blockquote>

A nightly cron job to check the status might be a good idea.

<h4>Rebuilding a mirror</h4>

When a drive failure happens, you will replace the failed drive, create the
RAID and other disklabel partitions, then rebuild the mirror.
Assuming your RAID volume is <tt>sd2</tt> and you are replacing the
failed device with <tt>sd1m</tt>, the following commands should work:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl -R /dev/sd1m sd2</b>
# <b>reboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

These steps can be performed in either
<a href="faq8.html#LostPW">single user mode</a>
or from the <a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">install kernel</a>.

<h3 id="softraidFDE">Full disk encryption</h3>

Much like RAID, full disk encryption in OpenBSD is handled by the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/softraid">softraid(4)</a> subsystem and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/bioctl">bioctl(8)</a> command.
This section covers installing OpenBSD to a single encrypted disk, and is a
very similar process to the previous one.
Note that <b>using both RAID and disk encryption on the same device is not
currently supported</b>.

<p>
Select (S)hell at the initial prompt.

<blockquote><pre>
Welcome to the OpenBSD/amd64 X.X installation program.
(I)nstall, (U)pgrade, (A)utoinstall or (S)hell? <b>s</b>
</pre></blockquote>

From here, you'll be given a shell within the live environment to manipulate
the disks.
For this example, we will install to the <tt>sd0</tt> SATA drive, erasing all
of its previous contents.
You may want to write random data to the drive first with something like the
following:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/rsd0c bs=1m</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This can be a very time-consuming process, depending on the speed of your
CPU and disk, as well as the size of the disk.
If you don't write random data to the whole device, it may be possible for an
adversary to deduce how much space is actually being used.

<p>
Next, we'll initialize the disk with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a> and create the softraid
partition with <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a>.

<p>
If you're booting from MBR, do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -iy sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If you use GPT for UEFI booting, do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -iy -g -b 960 sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Next, create the partition layout:

<blockquote><pre>

We'll use the entire disk, but note that the encrypted device can be
split up into multiple partitions as if it were a regular hard drive.

<p>
Now we can build the encrypted device on our "a" partition.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl -c C -l sd0a softraid0</b>
New passphrase:
Re-type passphrase:
sd1 at scsibus2 targ 1 lun 0: &lt;OPENBSD, SR CRYPTO, 005&gt; SCSI2 0/direct fixed
sd1: 19445MB, 512 bytes/sector, 39824607 sectors
softraid0: CRYPTO volume attached as sd1
</pre></blockquote>

Since the installer does not have many device nodes by default, we'll make
sure the <tt>/dev/sd1</tt> device is accounted for.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /dev && sh MAKEDEV sd1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

All data written to <tt>sd1</tt> will now be encrypted with AES in XTS mode.

<p>
As in the previous example, we'll overwrite the first megabyte of our new
pseudo-device.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd1c bs=1m count=1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Type <tt>exit</tt> to return to the main installer, then choose this new
device as the one for your installation.

<blockquote><pre>
[...]
Available disks are: sd0 sd1.
Which disk is the root disk? ('?' for details) [sd0] <b>sd1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You will be prompted for the passphrase on startup, but all other operations
should be handled transparently.

<h3 id="softraidCrypto">Encrypting external disks</h3>

Cryptographic softraid volumes can be set up rather simply.
This section explains how you might do so for an external USB flash drive,
but can be applied to any disk device.
If you already read the section on full disk encryption, this should be very
familiar.
An outline of the steps is as follows:

<ul>
  <li>Overwrite the drive's contents with random data
  <li>Create the desired RAID-type partition with disklabel(8)
  <li>Encrypt the drive (note that the initial creation of the container and
      attaching the container are done with the same bioctl(8) command)
  <li>Zero the first megabyte of the new pseudo-partition
  <li>Create a filesystem on the pseudo-device with
  <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/newfs">newfs(8)</a>
  <li>Unlock and <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount">mount(8)</a> the new
      pseudo-device
  <li>Access the files as needed
  <li>Unmount the drive and detach the encrypted container
</ul>

A quick example runthrough of the steps follows, with <tt>sd3</tt> being
the USB drive.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/rsd3c bs=1m</b>
# <b>fdisk -iy sd3</b>
# <b>disklabel -E sd3</b> (create an "a" partition, see above for more info)
# <b>bioctl -c C -l sd3a softraid0</b>
New passphrase:
Re-type passphrase:
softraid0: CRYPTO volume attached as sd4
# <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd4c bs=1m count=1</b>
# <b>fdisk -iy sd4</b>
# <b>disklabel -E sd4</b> (create an "i" partition, see above for more info)
# <b>newfs sd4i</b>
# <b>mkdir -p /mnt/secretstuff</b>
# <b>mount /dev/sd4i /mnt/secretstuff</b>
# <b>mv somefile /mnt/secretstuff/</b>
# <b>umount /mnt/secretstuff</b>
# <b>bioctl -d sd4</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Next time you need to access the drive, simply use bioctl(8) to attach it
and then repeat the last four commands as needed.

<p>
<!-- XXXrelease: remove this paragraph; bioctl(4) no longer says "delete." -->
The man page for this looks a little scary, as the <tt>-d</tt> command is
described as "deleting" the volume.
In the case of crypto, however, it just deactivates the encrypted volume so
it can't be accessed until it is activated again with the passphrase.
