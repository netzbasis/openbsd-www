<h2 id="intro">Disks and partitions</h2>

The details of setting up disks in OpenBSD vary between platforms, so
you should read the installation instructions in the
<tt>INSTALL.&lt;arch&gt;</tt> file for your
<a href="../plat.html">platform</a>
to determine the specifics for your system.

<h3>Drive identification</h3>

OpenBSD handles mass storage with two drivers on most platforms,
depending upon the normal command set that kind of device supports:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wd">wd(4)</a>:
    IDE-like disks: IDE, SATA, MFM or ESDI disks, or a flash device
    with an appropriate adapter, attached to a
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wdc">wdc(4)</a>
    or
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pciide">pciide(4)</a>
    interface.
  <li><a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sd">sd(4)</a>:
    SCSI-like disks:
    Devices that utilize SCSI commands, USB disks, SATA disks attached to an
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ahci">ahci(4)</a>
    interface, and disk arrays attached to a RAID controller.
</ul>

The first drive of a particular type identified by OpenBSD will be
drive <tt>0</tt>, the second will be <tt>1</tt>, etc.
So, the first IDE-like disk will be <tt>wd0</tt>, the third SCSI-like disk will
be <tt>sd2</tt>.
If you have two SCSI-like drives and three IDE-like drives on a system,
you would have <tt>sd0</tt>, <tt>sd1</tt>, <tt>wd0</tt>, <tt>wd1</tt> and
<tt>wd2</tt> on that machine.
The order is based on the order they are found during hardware discovery
at boot.
There are a few key points to keep in mind:

<ul>
  <li>
    Drives may not be numbered in the same order as your boot ROM
    attempts to boot them (i.e., your system may attempt to boot what OpenBSD
    identifies as <tt>wd2</tt> or <tt>sd1</tt>).
    Sometimes you may be able to change this, sometimes not.
  <li>Removing or adding a disk may impact the identity of other drives on
    the system.
</ul>

<h3>Partitioning</h3>

Due to historical reasons, the term "partition" is regularly used for
two different things in OpenBSD:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a>
    partitions, often called filesystem partitions.
  <li>
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a>
    partitions, often called Master Boot Record (MBR) partitions.
</ul>

All OpenBSD platforms use disklabel(8) as the primary way to manage
OpenBSD filesystem partitions.
Some platforms also require using fdisk(8) to manage MBR partitions.
On the platforms that use them, one fdisk partition is used
to hold all of the OpenBSD file systems.
This partition is then sliced up into 16 disklabel partitions,
labeled <tt>a</tt> through <tt>p</tt>.
A few of these are special:

<ul>
  <li><tt>a</tt>:
    On the boot disk, the <tt>a</tt> partition is your root partition.
  <li><tt>b</tt>:
    On the boot disk, the <tt>b</tt> partition is automatically used
    as a swap partition.
  <li><tt>c</tt>:
    On all disks, the <tt>c</tt> partition is the entire disk, from the
    first sector to the last.
</ul>

<h3>Partition identification</h3>

An OpenBSD filesystem is identified by the disk it is on, plus the
disklabel partition on that disk.
So, file systems may be identified by identifiers like <tt>sd0a</tt>
(the <tt>a</tt> partition of the first <tt>sd</tt> device),
<tt>wd2h</tt> (the <tt>h</tt> partition of the third <tt>wd</tt> device),
or <tt>sd1c</tt> (the entire second <tt>sd</tt> device).
The corresponding device files would be <tt>/dev/sd0a</tt> for the block device
and <tt>/dev/rsd0a</tt> for the raw (character) device, etc.
Remembering whether a rarely used command needs a block or a character device
is difficult.
Therefore, many commands make use of the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/opendev">opendev(3)</a>
function, which automatically expands <tt>sd0</tt> to <tt>/dev/rsd0c</tt> or
<tt>wd0a</tt> to <tt>/dev/wd0a</tt>, as appropriate.

<p>
If you put data on <tt>wd2d</tt>, then later remove <tt>wd1</tt>
from the system and reboot, your data is now on <tt>wd1d</tt>, as your old
<tt>wd2</tt> is now <tt>wd1</tt>.
However, a drive's identification won't change after boot, so if
a USB drive is unplugged or fails, it won't change the identification
of other drives until reboot.

<h3 id="DUID">Disklabel Unique Identifiers</h3>

Disks can also be identified by Disklabel Unique Identifiers (DUIDs), a
16 hex digit number, managed by the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/diskmap">diskmap(4)</a>
device.
This number is a random number generated when a disklabel is first created.
These UIDs are persistent -- if you identify your disks this way,
drive <tt>f18e359c8fa2522b</tt> will always be <tt>f18e359c8fa2522b</tt>,
no matter what order or how it is attached.
You can specify partitions on the disk by appending a period and the
partition letter, for example, <tt>f18e359c8fa2522b.d</tt> is the <tt>d</tt>
partition of the disk <tt>f18e359c8fa2522b</tt> and will always refer
to the same chunk of storage, no matter what order the device is attached
to the system, or what kind of interface it is attached to.

<h2 id="fdisk">Using fdisk</h2>

Be sure to check the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a>
man page.

<p>
fdisk(8) is used on some platforms (i386, amd64 and macppc)
to create a partition recognized by the system boot ROM, into
which the OpenBSD disklabel partitions can be placed.
Unlike the fdisk-like programs on some other operating systems,
OpenBSD's fdisk(8) assumes you know what you want to do.

<p>
Normally, only one OpenBSD fdisk partition will be placed on a disk.
That partition will be subdivided by <a href="#disklabel">disklabel</a>
into OpenBSD filesystem partitions.

<p>
To just view your partition table using fdisk, use:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>fdisk sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Which will give an output similar to this:

<blockquote><pre>
Disk: sd0       geometry: 553/255/63 [8883945 Sectors]
Offset: 0       Signature: 0xAA55
         Starting       Ending       LBA Info:
 #: id    C   H  S -    C   H  S [       start:      size   ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*0: A6    3   0  1 -  552 254 63 [       48195:     8835750 ] OpenBSD
 1: 12    0   1  1 -    2 254 63 [          63:       48132 ] Compaq Diag.
 2: 00    0   0  0 -    0   0  0 [           0:           0 ] unused
 3: 00    0   0  0 -    0   0  0 [           0:           0 ] unused
</pre></blockquote>

In this example, we are viewing the fdisk output of the first SCSI-like drive.
We can see the OpenBSD partition (id <tt>A6</tt>) and its size.
The <tt>*</tt> tells us that the OpenBSD partition is the bootable partition.

<p>
Edit the partition table with the <tt>-e</tt> flag:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -e sd0</b>
Enter 'help' for information
fdisk: 1>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>fdisk tricks and tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    fdisk(8) offers the ability to specify partitions both in raw sectors
    and in Cylinder/Head/Sector formats.
  <li>
    A totally blank disk will need to have the master boot record's boot code
    written to the disk before it can boot.
    You can use the <tt>reinit</tt> or <tt>update</tt> commands to do this.
  <li>
    If your system has a "maintenance" or "diagnostic" partition, it is
    recommended that you leave it in place or install it <b>before</b>
    installing OpenBSD.
  <li>
    For historical reasons, <tt>q</tt> saves changes and exits the program,
    and <tt>x</tt> exits without saving.
    This is the opposite of what many people are now used to in other
    environments.
    fdisk(8) does not warn before saving the changes, so use with care.
</ul>

<h2 id="disklabel">Using disklabel</h2>

<h3 id="disklabel.1">What is disklabel?</h3>

First, be sure to read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a> man page.

<p>
The details of setting up disks in OpenBSD varies somewhat between
platforms.
For <a href="../i386.html">i386</a>,
<a href="../amd64.html">amd64</a>
and <a href="../macppc.html">macppc</a>,
disk setup is done in two stages:
First, the OpenBSD slice of the hard disk is defined using fdisk(8),
then that slice is subdivided into OpenBSD partitions using
disklabel(8).

<p>
All OpenBSD platforms, however, use disklabel(8) as the primary way to
manage OpenBSD partitions.
Labels hold certain information about your disk, like your drive
geometry and information about the filesystems on the disk.
The disklabel is then used by the bootstrap program to access the drive and
to know where filesystems are contained on the drive.
You can read more in-depth information about disklabel in the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.5">disklabel(5)</a>
man page.

<p>
On some platforms, disklabel helps overcome architecture limitations on
disk partitioning.
For example, on i386, you can have four primary partitions.
With
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a>,
you use one of these primary partitions to store all of your OpenBSD partitions,
and you will still have 3 more partitions available for other OSs.

<h3 id="disklabel.2">disklabel(8) during OpenBSD's install</h3>

By default, the installer will allocate disklabels automatically.

<h3>Disklabel basics</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Get help:</b>
    In the command-driven mode, hitting <tt>?</tt> will produce a list of
    available commands.
    <tt>M</tt> will show the man page for disklabel(8).
  <li><b>Auto-partitioning:</b>
    New users are encouraged to use the <tt>A</tt> command to auto-create a
    recommended disklabel.
    You can then edit or alter the auto-created label as you need.
  <li><b>Reset to default:</b>
    In some cases, you may wish to completely restart from scratch and
    delete all existing disklabel information.
    The "D" command will reset the label back to default, as if there had
    never been a disklabel on the drive.
  <li><b><tt>q</tt> vs. <tt>x</tt>:</b>
    For historical reasons, while in the command-driven editor mode, <tt>q</tt>
    saves changes and exits the program, and "x" exits without saving.
    This is the opposite of what many people are now used to in other
    environments.
    disklabel(8) does warn before saving the changes, though it will <tt>x</tt>
    quickly and quietly.
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous disklabel tidbits</h3>

<ul>
  <li>(fdisk platforms) <b>Leave first track free:</b>
    On platforms using fdisk(8), you should leave the first logical track
    unused, both in disklabel(8) and in fdisk(8).
    For this reason, OpenBSD defaults to starting the first partition at
    block 64.
  <li>(sparc64) <b>Don't put swap at the very beginning of your disk.</b>
    While Solaris often puts swap at the very beginning of a disk, OpenBSD
    requires the boot partition to be at the beginning of the disk.
  <li><b>Devices without a disklabel:</b>
    If a device does not currently have an OpenBSD disklabel on it but has
    another file system (for example, a disk with a pre-existing FAT32 file
    system), the OpenBSD kernel will "create" one in memory, and that can form
    the basis of a formal OpenBSD disklabel to be stored on disk.
    However, if a disklabel is created and saved to disk, and a non-OpenBSD
    file system is added later, the disklabel will not be automatically
    updated.
    You must do this yourself if you wish OpenBSD to be able to access this
    file system.
    More on this <a href="faq14.html#foreignfs">below</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Recovering partitions after deleting the disklabel</h3>

If you have a damaged partition table, there are various things you can attempt
to do to recover it.

<p>
A copy of the disklabel for each disk is saved in <tt>/var/backups</tt> as part
of the daily system maintenance.
Assuming you still have the <tt>/var</tt> partition, you can simply read the
output, and put it back into disklabel.

<p>
In the event that you can no longer see that partition, there are two
options.
Fix enough of the disk so you can see it, or fix enough of the disk so
that you can get your data off.

<p>
The first tool you need is
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/scan_ffs">scan_ffs(8)</a>
which will look through a disk, and try and find partitions.
It will also tell you what information it finds about them.
You can use this information to recreate the disklabel.
If you just want <tt>/var</tt> back, you can recreate the partition for
<tt>/var</tt>, and then recover the backed up label and add the rest
from that.

<p>
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a>
will update both the kernel's understanding of the disklabel, and
then attempt to write the label to disk.
Therefore, even if the area of the disk containing the disklabel is
unreadable, you will be able to
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount">mount(8)</a>
it until the next reboot.

<h2 id="BootAmd64">The amd64 boot process</h2>

Details on the amd64 bootstrapping procedures are given in the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/boot_amd64">boot_amd64(8)</a>
man page.
There are four key pieces to the boot process:

<ol>
  <li><b>Master Boot Record (MBR) and GUID Partition Table (GPT):</b>
    The
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a>
    man page contains detailed explanations.
  <li><b>Partition Boot Record (PBR):</b>
    The first-stage boot loader
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/biosboot">biosboot(8)</a>
    occupies the first 512 bytes of the OpenBSD partition of the disk
    and is therefore called the PBR.
    It is installed by
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/installboot">installboot(8)</a>.
  <li><b>Second Stage Boot Loader <tt>/boot</tt>:</b>
    The
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/boot">boot(8)</a>
    program is loaded by the PBR and has the task of accessing the OpenBSD
    file system through the machine's BIOS.
    It locates and loads the kernel.
  <li><b>Kernel: <tt>/bsd</tt>:</b>
    The goal of the boot process is to have the OpenBSD kernel loaded into
    RAM and properly running.
    Once the kernel has loaded, OpenBSD accesses the hardware directly,
    no longer through the BIOS.
</ol>

So, the very start of the boot process could look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
Using drive 0, partition 3.                      <b>&lt;- MBR</b>
Loading....                                      <b>&lt;- PBR</b>

   ...
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="SoftUpdates">Soft updates</h2>

Soft updates are based on an idea proposed by
<a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/papers/CSE-TR-254-95/">Greg Ganger
and Yale Patt</a> and developed for FreeBSD by
<a href="http://www.mckusick.com/softdep/">Kirk McKusick</a>.
Soft updates imposes a partial ordering on the buffer cache
operations which permits the requirement for synchronous writing of
directory entries to be removed from the FFS code.
A large increase is seen in diskwriting performance as a result.

<p>
Enabling soft updates must be done with a mount-time option.
When mounting a partition with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount">mount(8)</a>
utility, you can specify that you wish to have soft updates enabled on
that partition.
Below is a sample
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fstab">fstab(5)</a>
entry that has one partition <tt>sd0a</tt> that we wish to have mounted
with soft updates.

<blockquote><pre>
/dev/sd0a / ffs rw,softdep 1 1
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="altroot">Duplicating your root partition: <tt>/altroot</tt></h2>

OpenBSD provides an <tt>/altroot</tt> facility in the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/daily">daily(8)</a>
scripts.
If the environment variable <tt>ROOTBACKUP=1</tt> is set in either
<tt>/etc/daily.local</tt> or root's
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/crontab.5">crontab(5)</a>,
and a partition is specified in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fstab">fstab(5)</a>
as mounting to <tt>/altroot</tt> with the mount options of <tt>xx</tt>, every
night the entire contents of the root partition will be duplicated to the
<tt>/altroot</tt> partition.

<p>
Assuming you want to back up your root partition to the partition specified
by the <a href="faq14.html#DUID">DUID</a> <tt>bfb4775bb8397569.a</tt>,
add the following to <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>

<blockquote><pre>
bfb4775bb8397569.a /altroot ffs xx 0 0
</pre></blockquote>

and set the appropriate environment variable in <tt>/etc/daily.local</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo ROOTBACKUP=1 >>/etc/daily.local</b>
</pre></blockquote>

As the <tt>/altroot</tt> process will capture your <tt>/etc</tt> directory, this
will make sure any configuration changes there are updated daily.
This is a "disk image" copy done with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dd">dd(1)</a>
not a file-by-file copy, so your <tt>/altroot</tt> partition should be at least
the same size as your root partition.
Generally, you will want your <tt>/altroot</tt> partition to be on a different
disk that has been configured to be fully bootable should the primary
disk fail.

<h2 id="foreignfs">Can I access data on filesystems other than FFS?</h2>

Yes.
Start with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount">mount(8)</a>
manual which contains examples explaining how to mount some of the
most commonly used filesystems.
A partial list of
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=mount_&amp;sec=8&amp;apropos=1">
supported filesystems</a>
and related commands can be obtained with

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>man -k -s 8 mount</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Note that support may be limited to read-only operation.

<h2 id="MountImage">Mounting disk images</h2>

To mount a disk image in OpenBSD you must configure a
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/vnd">vnd(4)</a>
device.
For example, if you have an ISO image located at <tt>/tmp/ISO.image</tt>,
you would take the following steps to mount the image.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>vnconfig vnd0 /tmp/ISO.image</b>
# <b>mount -t cd9660 /dev/vnd0c /mnt</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Since this is an ISO 9660 image, as used by CDs and DVDs, you must specify
type of <tt>cd9660</tt> when mounting it.

<p>
To unmount the image and unconfigure the vnd(4) device, do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>umount /mnt</b>
# <b>vnconfig -u vnd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

For more information, refer to
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/vnconfig">vnconfig(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount">mount(8)</a>.

<h2 id="NegSpace">Why does df tell me I have over 100% of my disk used?</h2>

People are sometimes surprised to find they have negative available disk space,
or more than 100% of a filesystem in use, as shown by
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/df">df(1)</a>.

<p>
When a filesystem is created with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/newfs">newfs(8)</a>,
some of the available space is held in reserve from normal users.
This provides a margin of error when you accidentally fill the disk, and
helps keep disk fragmentation to a minimum.
Default for this is 5% of the disk capacity, so if the root user has
been carelessly filling the disk, you may see up to 105% of the
available capacity in use.

<p>
If the 5% value is not appropriate for you, you can change it with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tunefs">tunefs(8)</a>
command.

<h2 id="softraid">RAID and disk encryption</h2>

The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/softraid">softraid(4)</a> subsystem works
by emulating a <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/scsibus">scsibus(4)</a>
with <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sd">sd(4)</a> devices made by combining a
number of OpenBSD <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a>
partitions into a virtual disk with the desired RAID level.
Note that only RAID0, RAID1, RAID5 and crypto are fully supported at the moment.
This virtual disk is treated as any other disk, first partitioned with
<a href="#fdisk">fdisk</a> (on fdisk platforms) and then
<a href="#disklabel">disklabels</a> are created as usual.

<h4>Some words on RAID in general:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Before implementing any RAID solution, understand what it will and
    will not do for you.
    It is not a replacement for a good backup strategy.
    It will not keep your system running through every hardware failure.
    It may not keep your system running through a simple disk failure.
    In the case of software RAID, it won't guarantee the ability to boot
    from the surviving drive if your computer could not otherwise do so.
  <li>
    Before going into production, you must understand how you use your
    RAID solution to recover from failures.
    The time to do this is <b>before</b> your system has had a failure event.
    Poorly implemented RAID will often cause more down time than it will
    prevent.
    This is even more true if it has caused you to become complacent on your
    backups or other disaster planning.
  <li>
    The bigger your RAIDed partitions are, the longer it will take to
    recover from an "event."
    In other words, this is an especially bad time to allocate all of your
    cheap 500GB drives just because they are there.
    Remirroring 500GB drives takes a much longer time than mirroring the
    4GB that you actually use.
    One advantage of software mirroring is one can control how much of
    those "huge" drives is actually used in a RAID set.
  <li>
    There is a reflex to try to RAID as much of your system as possible.
    Even hardware which CAN boot from RAIDed drives will often have difficulty
    determining when a drive has failed to avoid booting from it.
    OpenBSD's <a href="#altroot">altroot</a> system can actually be better
    for some applications, as it provides a copy of old configuration
    information in case a change does not work quite as intended.
  <li>
    RAID provides redundancy only for the disk system.
    Many applications need more redundancy than just the disks, and for some
    applications, RAID can be just added complication, rather than a real
    benefit.
    An example of this is a CARP'd set of firewalls providing complete
    failover redundancy.
    In this case, adding RAID (either via hardware or softraid) is just
    added complication.
</ul>

<h3 id="softraidDI">Installing to a mirror</h3>

The tools to assemble your softraid system are in the basic OpenBSD
install (for adding softraid devices after install), but they are
also available on the CD-ROM and <a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a>
for installing your system to a softraid setup.
This section covers installing OpenBSD to a mirrored pair of hard drives,
and assumes familiarity with the <a href="faq4.html">installation process</a>
and ramdisk kernel.
Disk setup may vary from platform to platform, and
<b>booting from softraid devices isn't supported on all of them</b>.
It's currently only possible to boot from RAID1, RAID5 and crypto volumes
on i386, amd64 and sparc64.

<p>
The installation process will be a little different than the standard
OpenBSD install, as you will want to drop to the shell and create your
softraid(4) drive before doing the install.
Once the softraid(4) disk is created, you will perform the install relatively
normally, placing the partitions you wish to be RAIDed on the newly
configured drive.
If it sounds confusing at first, don't worry.
All the steps will be explained in detail.

<p>
The install kernel only has the <tt>/dev</tt> entries for one
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/wd">wd(4)</a>
device and one
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sd">sd(4)</a>
device on boot, so you will need to manually create more disk devices
if your desired softraid setup requires them.

This process is normally done automatically by the installer, but you
haven't yet run the installer, and you will be adding a disk that didn't
exist at boot.
For example, if we needed to support a second and third sd(4) device
for a mirrored setup, you could do the following from the shell
prompt:

<blockquote><pre>
Welcome to the OpenBSD/amd64 X.X installation program.
(I)nstall, (U)pgrade, (A)utoinstall or (S)hell? <b>s</b>
# <b>cd /dev</b>
# <b>sh MAKEDEV sd1 sd2</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You now have full support for the <tt>sd0</tt>, the <tt>sd1</tt> and
<tt>sd2</tt> devices.

<p>
Next, we'll initialize the disks with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a> and create the softraid
partition with <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a>.
An "a" partition will be made on both of the drives for the new RAID device.
If you wish to boot from the MBR, do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -iy sd0</b>
Writing MBR at offset 0.
# <b>fdisk -iy sd1</b>
Writing MBR at offset 0.
# <b>disklabel -E sd0</b>
Label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)
> <b>a a</b>
offset: [64]
size: [39825135] <b>*</b>
FS type: [4.2BSD] <b>RAID</b>
> <b>w</b>
> <b>q</b>
No label changes.
</pre></blockquote>

If you use GPT for UEFI booting, the fdisk(8) command is:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -b 960 -giy sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will change the offset of the first disklabel slice to 1024.

<p>
You'll notice that we initialized both disks, but only created a partition
layout on the first drive.
That's because you can easily import the drive's configuration directly with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a> command.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>disklabel sd0 > layout</b>
# <b>disklabel -R sd1 layout</b>
# <b>rm layout</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The "layout" file in this example can be named anything.

<p>
Next, create the mirror with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/bioctl">bioctl(8)</a>
command.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl -c 1 -l sd0a,sd1a softraid0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Note that if you are creating multiple RAID devices, either on one disk
or on multiple devices, you're always going to be using the <tt>softraid0</tt>
virtual disk interface driver.
You won't be using "softraid1" or others.
The "softraid0" there is a virtual RAID controller, and you can hang many
virtual disks off this controller.

<p>
The new pseudo-disk device will show up as <tt>sd2</tt> here, assuming there
are no other sd(4) devices on your system.
This device will now show on the system console and dmesg as a newly
installed device:

<blockquote><pre>
scsibus1 at softraid0: 1 targets
sd2 at scsibus2 targ 0 lun 0: &lt;OPENBSD, SR RAID 1, 005&gt; SCSI2 0/direct fixed
sd2: 10244MB, 512 bytes/sec, 20980362 sec total
</pre></blockquote>

This shows that we now have a new SCSI bus and a new disk, <tt>sd2</tt>.
This volume will be automatically detected and assembled from this point
onward when the system boots.

<p>
Because the new device probably has a lot of garbage where you expect
a master boot record and disklabel, zeroing the first chunk of it is
highly recommended.
Be <b>very careful</b> with this command; issuing it on the wrong device
could lead to a very bad day.
This assumes that the new softraid device was created as <tt>sd2</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd2c bs=1m count=1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You are now ready to install OpenBSD on your system.
Perform the install as normal by invoking "install" or "exit" at the boot
media console.
Create all the partitions on your new softraid disk (<tt>sd2</tt> in our
example here) that should be there, rather than on <tt>sd0</tt> or <tt>sd1</tt>
(the non-RAID disks).

<p>
Now you can reboot your system and, if you have done things properly, it
will automatically assemble your RAID set and mount the appropriate
partitions.

<p>
To check on the status of your mirror, issue the following command:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl sd2</b>
</pre></blockquote>

A nightly cron job to check the status might also be a good idea.

<h4>Rebuilding a mirror</h4>

When a drive failure happens, you will replace the failed drive, create the
RAID and other disklabel partitions, then rebuild the mirror.
Assuming your RAID volume is <tt>sd2</tt> and you are replacing the
failed device with <tt>sd1m</tt>, the following commands should work:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl -R /dev/sd1m sd2</b>
# <b>reboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

These steps can be performed in either
<a href="faq8.html#LostPW">single user mode</a>
or from the <a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">install kernel</a>.

<h3 id="softraidFDE">Full disk encryption</h3>

Much like RAID, full disk encryption in OpenBSD is handled by the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/softraid">softraid(4)</a> subsystem and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/bioctl">bioctl(8)</a> command.
This section covers installing OpenBSD to a single encrypted disk, and is a
very similar process to the previous one.
Note that <b>using both RAID and disk encryption on the same device is not
currently supported</b>.

<p>
Select (S)hell at the initial prompt.

<blockquote><pre>
Welcome to the OpenBSD/amd64 X.X installation program.
(I)nstall, (U)pgrade, (A)utoinstall or (S)hell? <b>s</b>
</pre></blockquote>

From here, you'll be given a shell within the live environment to manipulate
the disks.
For this example, we will install to the <tt>sd0</tt> SATA drive, erasing all
of its previous contents.
You may want to write random data to the drive first with something like the
following:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/rsd0c bs=1m</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This can be a very time-consuming process, depending on the speed of your
CPU and disk, as well as the size of the disk.
If you don't write random data to the whole device, it may be possible for an
adversary to deduce how much space is actually being used.

<p>
Next, we'll initialize the disk with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fdisk">fdisk(8)</a> and create the softraid
partition with <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a>.
If you wish to boot from the MBR, do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -iy sd0</b>
Writing MBR at offset 0.
# <b>disklabel -E sd0</b>
Label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)
> <b>a a</b>			<!-- sparc64 users MUST use 'a a' here -->
offset: [64]
size: [39825135] <b>*</b>
FS type: [4.2BSD] <b>RAID</b>
> <b>w</b>
> <b>q</b>
No label changes.
</pre></blockquote>

If you use GPT for UEFI booting, the fdisk(8) command is:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -b 960 -giy sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will change the offset of the first disklabel slice to 1024.

<p>
We'll use the entire disk, but note that the encrypted device can be
split up into multiple partitions as if it were a regular hard drive.

<p>
Now we can build the encrypted device on our "a" partition.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl -c C -l sd0a softraid0</b>
New passphrase:
Re-type passphrase:
sd1 at scsibus2 targ 1 lun 0: &lt;OPENBSD, SR CRYPTO, 005&gt; SCSI2 0/direct fixed
sd1: 19445MB, 512 bytes/sector, 39824607 sectors
softraid0: CRYPTO volume attached as sd1
</pre></blockquote>

Since the installer does not have many device nodes by default, we'll make
sure the <tt>/dev/sd1</tt> device is accounted for.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /dev && sh MAKEDEV sd1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

All data written to <tt>sd1</tt> will now be encrypted with AES in XTS mode.

<p>
As in the previous example, we'll overwrite the first megabyte of our new
pseudo-device.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd1c bs=1m count=1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Type <tt>exit</tt> to return to the main installer, then choose this new
device as the one for your installation.

<blockquote><pre>
[...]
Available disks are: sd0 sd1.
Which disk is the root disk? ('?' for details) [sd0] <b>sd1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You will be prompted for the passphrase on startup, but all other operations
should be handled transparently.

<h3 id="softraidCrypto">Encrypting external disks</h3>

Cryptographic softraid volumes can be set up rather simply.
This section explains how you might do so for an external USB flash drive,
but can be applied to any disk device.
If you already read the section on full disk encryption, this should be very
familiar.
An outline of the steps is as follows:

<ul>
  <li>Overwrite the drive's contents with random data
  <li>Create the desired RAID-type partition with disklabel(8)
  <li>Encrypt the drive (note that the initial creation of the container and
      attaching the container are done with the same bioctl(8) command)
  <li>Zero the first megabyte of the new pseudo-partition
  <li>Create a filesystem on the pseudo-device with
  <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/newfs">newfs(8)</a>
  <li>Unlock and <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount">mount(8)</a> the new
      pseudo-device
  <li>Access the files as needed
  <li>Unmount the drive and detach the encrypted container
</ul>

A quick example runthrough of the steps follows, with <tt>sd3</tt> being
the USB drive.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/rsd3c bs=1m</b>
# <b>fdisk -iy sd3</b>
# <b>disklabel -E sd3</b> (create an "a" partition, see above for more info)
# <b>bioctl -c C -l sd3a softraid0</b>
New passphrase:
Re-type passphrase:
softraid0: CRYPTO volume attached as sd4
# <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd4c bs=1m count=1</b>
# <b>fdisk -iy sd4</b>
# <b>disklabel -E sd4</b> (create an "i" partition, see above for more info)
# <b>newfs sd4i</b>
# <b>mkdir -p /mnt/secretstuff</b>
# <b>mount /dev/sd4i /mnt/secretstuff</b>
# <b>mv somefile /mnt/secretstuff/</b>
# <b>umount /mnt/secretstuff</b>
# <b>bioctl -d sd4</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Next time you need to access the drive, simply use bioctl(8) to attach it
and then repeat the last four commands as needed.

<p>
<!-- XXXrelease: remove this paragraph; bioctl(4) no longer says "delete." -->
The man page for this looks a little scary, as the <tt>-d</tt> command is
described as "deleting" the volume.
In the case of crypto, however, it just deactivates the encrypted volume so
it can't be accessed until it is activated again with the passphrase.
