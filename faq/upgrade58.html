<i>Note: Upgrades are only supported from one release to the release
immediately following it.
Do not skip releases.
If you got lucky skipping releases in the past, you may not be lucky
this time.</i>

<p><i>
It is highly recommended that you read through and fully understand
this process before attempting it.
If you are doing it on a critical or physically remote machine, it is
recommended that you test this process on an identical, local system to
verify its success before attempting on a critical or remote computer.

Note that if your browser supports Javascript, details you may not need
are hidden, but can be revealed by clicking on the links marked with
"**", like this one immediately below.

** Before upgrading: things to think about and be aware of 
</a>
<div id="before" class="visible">
<blockquote>
This is <i>not</i> a complete list of the changes that took place
between 5.7 and 5.8, but rather some of the important things that will
impact users in the upgrade process.
For a more complete list of changes, see
<a href="../plus58.html">plus58.html</a> and the CVS change logs.

<ul>
<li><b>sudo replaced with doas</b><br>
<a name="doas"></a>
sudo has been replaced by the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=doas&amp;sektion=1">doas(1)</a>
command.
Usage is similar, but the program itself is much simpler (thus,
hopefully more secure) and the 
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=doas.conf&amp;sektion=5">configuration file</a>
is also much simpler.
However, <b>you should make sure you have direct access to the root
account when doing the upgrade, as the old sudo may not work and the new
doas won't be configured.</b>
For example, some people completely disable the root account and relied
on sudo to provide root-level access; this would be bad after this
upgrade!
Sudo, if desired, is available in ports.

<p>
<li><b>tip removed</b><br>
<a name="tipgone"></a>
tip(1) has been removed.
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=cu&amp;sektion=1">cu(1)</a>
(in the base install) has the functionality of tip.

<p>
<li><b>pf_rules and ipsec_rules variables</b><br>
<a name="rcconfrules"></a>
rc.conf no longer uses the pf_rules and ipsec_rules variables.
If you relied on those to have a different path to those files, you must
either move your rules to the standard locations, or create a file in
the standard location which "include"s your file.

<p>
<li><b>spamd rule change</b><br>
<a name="spamdrules"></a>
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=&amp;sektion=">spamd(8)</a>
now uses "divert-to" rules rather than "rdr-to".  Simple replacement of
"rdr-to" with "divert-to" should work for you. 

</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>

<a name="upgrade"></a>
<h2>The upgrade process</h2>

If you have access to the system's console, the easiest and safest way
to upgrade is to boot from the install kernel by boot media or
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> and follow the upgrade steps,
which are very similar to the <a href="faq4.html">install process</a>.
This is not always possible. 

<p>
Afterwards, complete the upgrade by following the <a href="#final">final
steps</a> as detailed below.
Pick one of the following install processes:

<p>
<a href="#upgrade" onclick="javascript:flip_visibility('InstKern')">
** Upgrade using Install Kernel (RECOMMENDED)</a>
<div id="InstKern" class="visible">

<blockquote>
<p>
This involves booting from the install kernel,
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a>.
This can be done by booting from an install floppy, CD, or file system image,
or you can place the 5.8 version of <tt>bsd.rd</tt> in the root of your
File system, and instructing the boot loader to boot this kernel instead
of your usual kernel (<tt>bsd</tt>).
On amd64 and i386, you do this by entering "<tt>boot bsd.rd</tt>" at the
initial <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt.

<p>
Once this kernel is booted, choose the "Upgrade" option, and follow the
prompts.
The upgrade process is very much like the installation process, though
it retains all your configuration info.

</blockquote>
</div>

<a href="#upgrade" onclick="javascript:flip_visibility('NoInstKern')">
** Upgrade without the Install Kernel</a>
<div id="NoInstKern" class="visible">
<blockquote>
<i>This is NOT the recommended process.  Use the install kernel method
if at all possible!</i>

<p>
Sometimes, one needs to do an upgrade of a machine when one can't easily
use the normal upgrade process.
The most common case is when the machine is in a remote location and you
don't have easy access to the system console.
One can usually do this by carefully following this process:

<ul>
<li><b>Place install files in a "good" location</b>.
Make sure you have sufficient space!
Running out of space on a remote upgrade could be...unfortunate.
Note that using softdeps can exaggerate the situation as deleted and
overwritten files do not release their space immediately.
Having at least 200MB free on /usr would be recommended.

<p>
<li><b>Become root with ksh(1):</b>
While using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=doas&amp;sektion=1">doas(1)</a>
or sudo
before each command is generally a good practice, the command will likely
be broken by the last steps, so you should become root before starting
this process.
Note that since sudo is replaced by doas(1) in this release, and doas
will not be configured, it might be good to verify your access to root
using a method OTHER than sudo at this point (i.e., direct login or using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=su&amp;sektion=1">su(1)</a>.
Also, the use of the OpenBSD
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=ksh&amp;sektion=1">ksh(1)</a>
shell is assumed.

<p>
<li><b>Stop and/or disable any appropriate applications:</b>
During this process, all the userland applications will be replaced but
may not be runnable, and strange things may happen as a result.
You may also have issues with DNS resolution during the first reboot, so
PF rules and NFS mounts dependent upon DNS may cause boot-up problems.
There may be other applications which you wish to keep from running
immediately after the upgrade, stop and disable them as well.

<p>
<li><b>Install new boot blocks:</b>
This should actually be done at the end of any upgrade, but we will
assume this has been neglected.
Failure to do this may break serial console or other things, depending
on your platform.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>installboot -v sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>Install new kernel(s):</b>
<ul>
<li>If you are using the multiprocessor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd.mp /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd /</b>
<b>cp bsd /bsd.sp</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>If using a single processor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd bsd.mp /</b>
</pre></blockquote>
(note: you will get a harmless error message if your platform doesn't
have a bsd.mp):

</ul>

<p>
Note the extra steps for copying over the primary kernel: those are done
to ensure that there is always a valid copy of the kernel on the disk
that the system can boot from should there be a really badly timed power
outage or system crash.

<p>
<li><b>Save a copy of reboot(8), install new userland applications.</b>
You are still running the old kernel, it is possible the new reboot
command will not run on the old kernel, so we will start by saving a
copy of the old reboot command.
Note that we are installing base58.tgz LAST, because it will include a new
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=tar&amp;sektion=1">tar(1)</a>
utility, which may or may not run on the old kernel.
We reboot immediately, as the system is probably barely runnable after
the unpacking of all the new files.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cp /sbin/reboot /sbin/oreboot</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xserv58.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xfont58.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xshare58.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xbase58.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf game58.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf comp58.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf man58.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf base58.tgz</b> # Install last!
<b>/sbin/oreboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Not all file sets will need to be installed for all applications,
however if you installed a file set originally, you should certainly
upgrade it with the new file set now.

<p>
<li><b>After reboot completes, upgrade <tt>/dev</tt>.</b>
The new
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=MAKEDEV&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">MAKEDEV</a>
file was copied to /dev by the installation of
<tt>base58.tgz</tt>, so you simply need to do the following:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /dev</b>
<b>./MAKEDEV all</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li><b>Install the upgraded boot loader:</b>
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=installboot&amp;sektion=8">installboot(8)</a>
has been "unified" across platforms, so a common (and simplified!) syntax
can be used:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>installboot -v sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>
assuming "sd0" is your boot disk.

<p>
<li><b>Upgrading firmware:</b>
There may be new firmware for your system.
Update it with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=fw_update&amp;sektion=1">fw_update(1)</a>:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>fw_update</b>
</pre></blockquote>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>

<hr>
<a name="final"></a>
<h2>Final steps</h2>

Whether you upgrade by using an install kernel and doing a formal
"upgrade" process, or do a "in-place" binary upgrade, you need to do a
few final steps to complete the upgrade.

<p>
<a name="sysmerge"></a>
<h3>1.
<a href="#sysmerge" onclick="javascript:flip_visibility('RunSysmerge')">
** Run sysmerge(8)
</a></h3>
<div id="RunSysmerge" class="visible">
<blockquote>
The
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=sysmerge&amp;sektion=8">sysmerge(8)</a>
utility will compare the files that are actually on your system with
those that would be installed in a fresh install, and assist you in
merging the changes into your system.
There are no assumptions made about
what is actually on your system, so you can use sysmerge(8) to move
between more arbitrary <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">points in the
development process</a>, such as from an earlier <i>5.7-current</i> to
<i>5.8-release</i> or from one <i>-current</i> to a later one.
Sysmerge(8) compares the current files on your system with the files
that would have been installed with a new install, and what would have
been there from the last run of sysmerge.
Usually, it can figure out what to do to update your files.
If it has difficulty, it will give you the option of keeping the old
file, installing the new file, or assisting you in the manual merging of
the old and new files, using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=sdiff&amp;sektion=1">sdiff</a>.

<p>
Please read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=sysmerge&amp;sektion=8">sysmerge(8)</a>
manual page before using it on your system.
You are also advised to read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=diff&amp;sektion=1">diff(1)</a>,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=sdiff&amp;sektion=1">sdiff(1)</a>
and even review
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=more&amp;sektion=1">more(1)</a>
manual pages before continuing.
A wide terminal window (i.e., significantly more than 80 characters), if
available, will make sdiff(1) easier to use.

<p>
Sysmerge(8) is run simply by invoking it as root:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>sysmerge</b>
</pre></blockquote>

For the files sysmerge(8) can't resolve on its own, it will show you a
unified
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=diff&amp;sektion=1">diff(1)</a>,
run through your favorite $PAGER (i.e.,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=more&amp;sektion=1">more(1)</a>)
and ask you if you wish to:
<blockquote><pre>
  Use 'd' to delete the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'i' to install the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'm' to merge the temporary and installed versions
  Use 'v' to view the diff results again

  Default is to leave the temporary file to deal with by hand
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you wish to retain your existing file, delete the temporary file.
If you wish to replace your existing file with the new version, install the
temporary file.
If you wish to merge the two together, choosing 'm' will put you into
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=sdiff&amp;sektion=1">sdiff(1)</a>,
where you can manually merge the file.
The default is to come back and deal with the file later, manually.

<p>
Sysmerge(8) saves all your replaced files into a temporary directory,
similar to <tt>/var/tmp/sysmerge.24959/backups</tt>, so if you accidentally
clobber something that was probably not such a good idea, you have a chance
to recover it. Note that
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=daily&amp;sektion=8">daily(8)</a>
cleans old files from this directory, but it will survive a reboot.
</blockquote></div>

<a name="RmFiles"></a>
<h3>2.
Files to delete and move
</h3>
Some files should be deleted from your system. <!--, and others
must be moved or updated.
Note that some of these may not exist on all systems; that's ok.
The list of commands to run is broken up into modest size blocks; some
slower hardware will have trouble keeping up with one large copy/paste. -->
<blockquote><pre>
<b>
rm -f /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/sudoedit /usr/sbin/visudo
rm -f /usr/share/man/man8/sudo.8 /usr/share/man/man8/sudoedit.8
rm -f /usr/share/man/man8/visudo.8 /usr/share/man/man5/sudoers.5
rm -f /usr/libexec/sudo_noexec.so
</b></pre></blockquote>


<p>
<a name="Pkgup"></a>
<h3>3. Upgrading packages</h3>
If you installed any packages on your system, you should upgrade them
after completing the upgrade of the base system.
Be aware, however, many packages will require further setup before
and/or after upgrading the package.
Check with the application's upgrade guide for details.

<p><a href="#Pkgup" onclick="javascript:flip_visibility('PkgTips')"
>** Package Upgrade Tips</a>
<div id="PkgTips" class="visible">
<blockquote>
The following packages are known to have significant upgrade issues that
will impact users.
The fact that a package is not on this list doesn't mean it will have a
trivial upgrade.
You must do some homework on the applications YOU use.

<ul>
<li><b>rc script name changes.</b><br>
The rc scripts for some ports have changed their name to better match
the original upstream names and/or binary name:
<ul>
  <li><tt>dbus_daemon</tt> -> <tt>messagebus</tt>
  <li><tt>puppetmasterd</tt> -> <tt>puppetmaster</tt>
  <li><tt>puppetd</tt> -> <tt>puppet</tt>
  <li><tt>radiusd</tt> -> <tt>freeradius</tt>
</ul>

Modify <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> accordingly:
<blockquote><pre>
perl -pi -e 's/dbus_daemon/messagebus/;' -e 's/puppetmasterd/puppetmaster/;' \
   -e 's/puppetd/puppet/;' -e 's/radiusd/freeradius/;' /etc/rc.conf.local
</pre></blockquote>


<li><b>www/apache-httpd updated to 2.4.12.</b><br>
Apache HTTPD is now at 2.4.12. When upgrading from 2.2.x releases manual
configuration changes may be required. See the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html">Apache HTTPD 2.4 upgrade guide</a> for details.
<br>
The ap2-mod_fastcgi and ap2-mod_fcgid ports have been superseded by
mod_proxy_fcgi which ships with Apache HTTPD 2.4 out of the box.


<p>
<li><b>CUPS GTK+2 plugin is now in a separate package</b><br>
The plugin to allow printer selection from GTK+2 applications, previously in
the main GTK+2 package, has now been separated.
To be able to use CUPS printers from these applications (including GIMP,
Firefox, etc), install the gtk+2-cups package.

<p>
<li><b>default PHP version switched to 5.6</b><br>
The default version of PHP has been switched to 5.6.
After updating to new packages, you will need to move the configuration
across from 5.5.
Check for local changes in /etc/php-5.5.ini and apply them to php-5.6.ini,
and create new symbolic links for any required extensions in /etc/php-5.6.
For the common case where you would like to keep existing extensions
you can do this:
<pre>
# cd /etc/php-5.5
# for i in *; do ln -s ../php-5.6.sample/$i ../php-5.6/; done
</pre>
Note that pkg_add -u will <b>not</b> move to the newer php-fpm release
version; most users will need to manually pkg_delete php-fpm and then
pkg_add the new version.<p>
Additionally note that there have been <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.openssl.php">changes
to PHP 5.6's SSL/TLS support</a>.
When a PHP script makes an SSL/TLS client connection, peer certificates
are now verified by default, which was not the case previously.
Since the standard CA certificate bundle is outside the chroot jail
frequently used with PHP on OpenBSD, you may need to copy this across
to allow client connections to function.
<pre>
# mkdir -p /var/www/etc/ssl
# cp /etc/ssl/cert.pem /var/www/etc/ssl/
</pre>


</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>
The package tools support in-place updating using <tt>pkg_add -u</tt>.
For instance, to update all your packages, make sure <tt>PKG_PATH</tt> is
pointing to the 5.8 packages directory on your CD or nearest FTP mirror,
and use something like

<blockquote><pre>
<b>pkg_add -u</b>
</pre></blockquote>

where the <tt>-u</tt> indicates update mode;
pkg_add will prompt you for input when it encounters
some ambiguity.
Read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/?query=pkg_add&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+5.8">pkg_add(1)</a>
manual page and the <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">package management</a>
chapter of the FAQ for more information.
