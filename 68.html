<h3>What's New</h3>
<p>
This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 6.8.
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="plus68.html">changelog</a> leading
to 6.8.

<ul>

<li>New/extended platforms:
  <ul>
	<li>New <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/powerpc64.html">powerpc64</a>
        platform, supporting PowerNV (non-virtualized) systems with
        POWER8 and POWER9 CPUs, such as Raptor Computing Systems Talos
        II and Blackbird systems.  POWER8 support has not been tested
        on real hardware yet.
  </ul>

<li>Improvements to time measurements, mostly in the kernel:
  <ul>
	<li>Added support in the kernel and libc for timecounting in
	userland, eliminating the need for a context switch everytime a
	process requests the current time, thereby improving speed and
	responsiveness in programs which make many <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/gettimeofday">gettimeofday(2)</a> calls,
	especially browsers and office software.<br>The userland timecounters
	are enabled on the amd64, arm64, macppc, octeon and sparc64
	architectures.
	<li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ktrace">ktrace(1)</a> -T option to make time-related system calls more prominent.
	<li>Added tsc_delay(), a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/delay">delay(9)</a> implementation based on the TSC, to amd64.
	<li>Used an LFENCE instruction everywhere RDTSC is used for a time measurement, reducing the jitter in TSC skew measurements.
	<li>Introduced <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/gettime">gettime(9)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getuptime">getuptime(9)</a> and substituted these for time_second(9) and time_uptime(9) throughout the kernel to prevent split-read problems on 32-bit platforms.
	<li>Synchronized each core's CP0 cycle counter using the IO clock counter on mips64 and octeon, making the cycle counter usable as timecounter.
	<li>Improved CPU frequency scaling in automatic performance mode by removing accounting for offline CPUs.
  </ul>

<li>Various kernel improvements:
  <ul>
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/intrmap_create">intrmap</a>, an interrupt to CPU mapping API that is used by hardware drivers to use multiple CPUs for interrupt handling.
	<li>Added an ioctl PCIOCGETVPD allowing userland to access read-only support information about pci devices via the vpd register.
	<li>Set <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb">ddb(4)</a> "/t" to show a trace via TID on all architectures.
	<li>Introduced <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kstat">kstat(1)</a>, a subsystem to allow the kernel to expose statistics to userland.  The userland utility is not yet installed by default.
	<li>Added kstat to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cnmac">cnmac(4)</a>.
	<li>Added support for remote coverage to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kcov">kcov(4)</a>.
	<li>Moved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2">sysctl(2)</a> CTL_DEBUG from DEBUG to the new DEBUG_SYSCTL.
	<li>Prevented creation of bogus <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sd">sd(4)</a> devices for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nvme">nvme(4)</a> namespaces which are configured but have size 0.
	<li>Added READ(12)/WRITE(12) support to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cd">cd(4)</a>.
	<li>Used READ(16)/WRITE(16) commands for disks large enough to require them to access the last sectors, fixing large 512E devices plugged into USB to ATA/ATAPI bridges which mistakenly use 4K sector addresses/sizes.
	<li>Restored VGA fonts on VT switch, preventing an unusable screen when switching to a VT with a custom VGA font from X.
	<li>Ensured only pseudo-terminal devices use reprint delays.
	<li>Prevented improper disabling of the backlight in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/umstc">umstc(4)</a> when brightness is adjusted to 0.
	<li>Provided an optimized implementation of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ffs">ffs(3)</a> in the kernel on arm64/powerpc/powerpc64.
	<li>Rewrote m88k mutex code as a slight variation of the MI mutex code, potentially improving stability and rendering mutex spinning time visible in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/top">top(1)</a>.
	<li>Reworked kernel loading with octboot, the OpenBSD/octeon bootloader, which now does not rely on a mounted filesystem.
	<li>Ensured <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scsi.4">scsi(4)</a> devices do not attempt to process bogus MODE SENSE data.
  </ul>

<li>Various new userland features:
  <ul>

	<li>Supported -T html -O tag in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.1">man(1)</a> by passing a file:// URI to the pager.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fstat">fstat(1)</a> support for looking up unix domain sockets by file name.
	<li>Added / as an alias for g (grep) in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/top">top(1)</a>.
	<li>Provided a naptime variable for userspace via <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kvm_read">kvm_read(3)</a>, usable by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmstat">vmstat(8)</a>.
	<li>Allowed switching between alternate devices (-F) with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sndioctl">sndioctl(1)</a>.
	<li>Added the ability to set and display <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/video">video(1)</a> control values directly on the CLI.

	<li>Support <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_CTX_set_mode#SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY">SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY</a> in TLSv1.3 to allow the automatic retry of handshake messages.
	<li>Improve the handling of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BIO_read">BIO_read(3)</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BIO_write">BIO_write(3)</a> failures in the TLSv1.3 stack.
	<li>Start replacing the existing TLSv1.2 record layer.
	<li>Simplify SSL method lookups.
	<li>Clean up and simplify <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_get_ciphers">SSL_get_ciphers(3)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_set_session">SSL_set_session(3)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_set_ssl_method">SSL_set_ssl_method(3)</a> and several internal functions.
	<li>Refactor dtls1_new(), dtls1_hm_fragment_new(), dtls1_drain_fragments(), dtls1_clear_queues().
	<li>Make the message type available in the internal TLS extensions API functions.
	<li>Numerous <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl">openssl(1)</a> subcommands were converted to the new option handling.
	<li>Copy the session ID directly in ssl_get_prev_session() instead of handing it through several functions for copying.
	<li>Clean up and refactor ssl_get_prev_session(); simplify tls_decrypt_ticket() and tls1_process_ticket() exit paths.
      </ul>

    <li>Portable Improvements
    <ul>
	<li>Make pthread_mutex static initialisation work on Windows.
	<li>Get __STRICT_ALIGNMENT from machine/endian.h with portable build.
    </ul>

    <li>Bug Fixes
    <ul>
	<li>Fix an off-by-one in the CBC padding removal.
	<li>Enforce in the TLSv1.3 server that that ClientHello messages after a HelloRetryRequest match the original ClientHello as per RFC 8446 section 4.1.2
	<li>Avoid calling freezero with a negative size if a server sends a malformed plaintext of all zeroes.
	<li>Correct use of sockaddr_storage instead of sockaddr in openssl(1) s_client, which could lead to using 14 bytes of stack garbage instead of an IPv6 address in DTLS mode.
	<li>Fix a longstanding bug in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio">PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio(3)</a> that could cause use-after-free and double-free issues in calling programs.

	<li>Ensure that appropriate alerts are sent on various error conditions.
	<li>Move state initialization from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_clear">SSL_clear(3)</a> to ssl3_clear() to ensure that it gets correctly reinitialized across a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_set_ssl_method">SSL_set_ssl_method(3)</a> call.
	<li>Add a custom copy handler for AES keywrap to fix a use-after-free.
	<li>Avoid an out-of-bounds write in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_rand">BN_rand(3)</a>.
	<li>Fix numerous leaks in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/UI_new">UI_dup_*(3)</a> functions. Simplify and tidy up the code in ui_lib.c.
	<li>Correctly track selected ALPN length to avoid a potential segmentation fault with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_get0_alpn_selected">SSL_get0_alpn_selected(3)</a> when alpn_selected is NULL.

	<li>Fail on receiving an invalid NID in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_ATTRIBUTE_create">X509_ATTRIBUTE_create(3)</a> instead of constructing a broken objects that may cause NULL pointer accesses.
	<li>Fix <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_shutdown">SSL_shutdown(3)</a> behavior in TLSv1.3 to match the legacy stack.  The previous behavior could cause a hang.
	<li>Modify "openssl x509" to display invalid certificate times as invalid, and correctly deal with the failing return case from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_cmp_time">X509_cmp_time(3)</a> so that a certificate with an invalid NotAfter does not appear valid.
    </ul>
  </ul>

<li>OpenSSH 8.4
  <ul>
    <li>Potentially incompatible changes.
    <ul>
 	<li>For FIDO/U2F support, OpenSSH recommends the use of libfido2
1.5.0 or greater. Older libraries have limited support at the expense
of disabling particular features. These include resident keys, PIN-
required keys and multiple attached tokens.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
the format of the attestation information optionally recorded when a
FIDO key is generated has changed. It now includes the authenticator
data needed to validate attestation signatures. 
 	<li>The API between OpenSSH and the FIDO token middleware has
changed and the SSH_SK_VERSION_MAJOR version has been incremented as a
result. Third-party middleware libraries must support the current API
version (7) to work with OpenSSH 8.4.
 	<li>The portable OpenSSH distribution now requires automake to
rebuild the configure script and supporting files. This is not
required when simply building portable OpenSSH from a release tar
file.
    </ul>
    <li>New Features
    <ul>
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
support for FIDO keys that require a PIN for each use. These keys may
be generated using ssh-keygen using a new "verify-required" option.
When a PIN-required key is used, the user will be prompted for a PIN
to complete the signature operation.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>:
authorized_keys now supports a new "verify-required" option to require
FIDO signatures assert that the token verified that the user was
present before making the signature. The FIDO protocol supports
multiple methods for user-verification, but currently OpenSSH only
supports PIN verification.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>, <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: add
support for verifying FIDO webauthn signatures. Webauthn is a standard
for using FIDO keys in web browsers. These signatures are a slightly
different format to plain FIDO signatures and thus require explicit
support.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>: allow some
keywords to expand shell-style ${ENV} environment variables. The
supported keywords are CertificateFile, ControlPath, IdentityAgent and
IdentityFile, plus LocalForward and RemoteForward when used for Unix
domain socket paths.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>, <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent">ssh-agent(1)</a>: allow some
additional control over the use of ssh-askpass via a new
$SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE environment variable, including forcibly enabling
and disabling its use.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>: allow <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config">ssh_config(5)</a>'s
AddKeysToAgent keyword accept a time limit for keys in addition to its
current flag options. Time- limited keys will automatically be removed
from ssh-agent after their expiry time has passed.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp">scp(1)</a>, <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp">sftp(1)</a>: allow the -A flag to
explicitly enable agent forwarding in scp and sftp. The default
remains to not forward an agent, even when ssh_config enables it.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>: add a '%k'
TOKEN that expands to the effective HostKey of the destination. This
allows, e.g., keeping host keys in individual files using
"UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts.d/%k".
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>: add %-TOKEN,
environment variable and tilde expansion to the UserKnownHostsFile
directive, allowing the path to be completed by the configuration.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
allow "ssh-add -d -" to read keys to be deleted from stdin.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: improve
logging for MaxStartups connection throttling.  sshd will now log when
it starts and stops throttling and periodically while in this state.
    </ul>
    <li>Bugfixes
    <ul>
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>, <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: better
support for multiple attached FIDO tokens. In cases where OpenSSH
cannot unambiguously determine which token to direct a request to, the
user is now required to select a token by touching it. In cases of
operations that require a PIN to be verified, this avoids sending the
wrong PIN to the wrong token and incrementing the token's PIN failure
counter (tokens effectively erase their keys after too many PIN
failures).
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: fix Include
before Match in <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config">sshd_config(5)</a>.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>: close
stdin/out/error when forking after authentication completes ("ssh -f
...").
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>, <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: limit the amount of
channel input data buffered, avoiding peers that advertise large
windows but are slow to read from causing high memory consumption.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent">ssh-agent(1)</a>:
handle multiple requests sent in a single write() to the agent.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: allow <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config">sshd_config(5)</a> longer than 256k
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: avoid
spurious "Unable to load host key" message when sshd load a private
key but no public counterpart
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>: prefer the
default hostkey algorithm list whenever we have a hostkey that matches
its best-preference algorithm.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">ssh(1)</a>: when
ordering the hostkey algorithms to request from a server, prefer
certificate types if the known_hosts files contain a key marked as a
@cert-authority;
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>: perform host
key fingerprint comparisons for the "Are you sure you want to continue
connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?" prompt with case sensitivity.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: ensure that
address/masklen mismatches in sshd_config yield fatal errors at daemon
start time rather than later when they are evaluated.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
ensure that certificate extensions are lexically sorted. Previously if
the user specified a custom extension then the everything would be in
order except the custom ones.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>: also compare
username when checking for JumpHost loops.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
preserve group/world read permission on known_hosts files across runs
of "ssh-keygen -Rf /path". The old behaviour was to remove all rights
for group/other.
	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
Mention the [-a rounds] flag in the ssh-keygen manual page and
usage().
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: explicitly construct path to ~/.ssh/rc rather than
relying on it being relative to the current directory, so that it
can still be found if the shell startup changes its directory.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: when
redirecting sshd's log output to a file, undo this redirection after
the session child process is forked(). Fixes missing log messages when
using this feature under some circumstances.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: start
ClientAliveInterval bookkeeping before first pass through select()
loop; fixed theoretical case where busy sshd may ignore timeouts from
client.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>: only reset the
ServerAliveInterval check when we receive traffic from the server and
ignore traffic from a port forwarding client, preventing a client from
keeping a connection alive when it should be terminated.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
avoid spurious error message when ssh-keygen creates files outside
~/.ssh
 	<li><a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: fix
off-by-one error that caused sftp downloads to make one more
concurrent request than desired. This prevented using <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp">sftp(1)</a> in unpipelined
request/response mode, which is useful when debugging.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>, <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: handle EINTR in
waitfd() and timeout_connect() helpers.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>, <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>: defer
creation of ~/.ssh until we attempt to write to it so we don't leave
an empty .ssh directory when it's not needed.
 	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>, <a
href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>: fix multiplier when
parsing time specifications when handling seconds after other units.

<section id=quickinstall>
<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the use of
the "<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel</a> -E" command.
If you are at all confused when installing OpenBSD, read the relevant
INSTALL.* file as listed above!

<h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install68.iso</i> or
<i>cd68.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install68.iso</i> or
<i>cd68.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install68.img</i> or
<i>miniroot68.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/arm64:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot68.img</i> to a disk and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.arm64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/armv7:</h3>

<p>
Write a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install68.iso</i> or
<i>cd68.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install68.img</i> or
<i>miniroot68.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot68.img</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot68.img</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/6.8/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install68.img</i> or <i>miniroot68.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and coose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sgi:</h3>

<p>
To install, burn cd68.iso on a CD-R, put it in the CD drive of your
machine and select <i>Install System Software</i> from the System Maintenance
menu. Indigo/Indy/Indigo2 (R4000) systems will not boot automatically from
CD-ROM, and need a proper invocation from the PROM prompt.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<p>
If your machine doesn't have a CD drive, you can setup a DHCP/tftp network
server, and boot using "bootp()/bsd.rd.IP##" using the kernel matching your
system type. Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy68.img</i> or <i>floppyB68.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot68.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 6.7 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade68.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=sourcecode>
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=ports>
<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>

[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 6.8 release will be made available if problems arise.

If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
