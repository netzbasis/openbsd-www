<hr>

It is easy to donate money to OpenBSD using direct bank transfers using
the following information:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5><tr><td>
    From Inside Europe (SEPA):<br>
    <br>
    <b>IBAN:</b> DE91 7007 0024 0338 1779 00<br>
    <b>BIC:</b> DEUTDEDBMUC<br>
    Name: Theo de Raadt<br>
    Address: Deutsche Bank, Marienplatz 21<br>
    80331 M&uuml;nchen, Germany<br>
</td><td>
    From outside Europe:<br>
    <br>
    <b>SWIFT:</b> DEUTDEDBMUC<br>
    <b>Account:</b> 7007 0024 0338 1779 00<br>
    Name: Theo de Raadt<br>
    Address: Deutsche Bank, Marienplatz 21<br>
    80331 M&uuml;nchen, Germany<br>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
If the transfer process has a comment field, give the name you want
to see listed on our <a href="donations.html">Donations page</a> and
perhaps mail Theo a gentle reminder to notice it.  Please note that
these transfers are strictly donations -- the project does not like
transactions which appear to be in exchange for advertising via links.
<p>
These bank transfer systems can have various transaction fees.
In general with the new IBAN system there should be no or minimal
costs when the transfer is made between two banks which are in the
European Community or the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).
If there is such an option, you should select 'share both costs' as that
will put you into the 'EUR 0.00 charge' catagory.  Sometimes if you select
'charge all costs to sender' (or receiver), they do charge outrageous costs.
This is plain wrong as all transactions should be charged at the same cost as
a national transfer, as per 01-06-2003. You should complain if they do this.
<p>
Choose to use the IBAN system over the SWIFT system, as SWIFT is more expensive.
As well, note that Greek banks are notorious for charging costs at the
expense of customers...  For example, Eurobank charges EUR 5 for
outgoing transfers and EUR 3 for incoming ones...
