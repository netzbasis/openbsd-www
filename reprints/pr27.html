<h2>OpenBSD 2.7 Press Release</h2>

Calgary, Canada -- OpenBSD announces release 2.7 of the
"Secure by Default" operating system for Internet servers
and workstations. OpenBSD 2.7 significantly enhances the 
built-in strong cryptography with the OpenSSH suite to
support the SSH 1 and 2 secure communication protocols
and drivers for hardware accelerators for IPsec VPNs.
<p>

"OpenBSD's principal goal of security and stability is
NETSEC's basis for using it as foundation of our managed
security solution," stated Todd Waskelis, NETSEC Vice
President.  "We've even funded the development efforts of
the hardware crypto support in OpenBSD 2.7, which allows
us to deliver high bandwidth VPN connections cost-effectively
to our clients, and as a bonus, anyone can do it themselves
since the code is free".
<p>

OpenBSD's cryptography has been further enhanced by encrypting
virtual memory swap space, and by more flexible ISAKMPD key
exchange and operating modes for IP Security networking. OpenBSD
completely avoids the US export controls on cryptography because
it is published in Canada with cryptographic software developed
entirely outside the USA. Support for SSH1 and HTTPS secure
protocols depends on the RSA public key algorithm patented in
the USA. Users worldwide may use the OpenSSL free library
while those in the USA must use the non-commercial
RSAREF library to abide by the patent.
<p>

"This is the last release where we have to worry about the
RSA patent since it expires on September 21", says project
leader Theo de Raadt. "RSA is the premier key exchange
algorithm and this patent has held a greater stranglehold on
cryptographic operations than any government policy".
<p>

OpenBSD's SSH support is done with the free OpenSSH suite
also developed by OpenBSD team members. The suite has been
ported to other systems and is rapidly gaining in popularity.
<p>

OpenBSD 2.7 improves support for high end system boards, SCSI
controllers, ethernet interfaces, and adds gigabit ethernet
drivers and IPv6 networking. There are over 500 pre-compiled
application packages ready to install, and most Linux binaries
run without recompiling thanks to the emulation system.
<p>

OpenBSD is free software, released under a Berkeley-style
open source license. It is developed by a team of Internet
volunteers, based on UC Berkeley's 4.4BSD-Lite. OpenBSD runs
on PCs, SPARC, Mac68K and other hardware. All development
is funded by donations and the sale of CD-ROMs and T-shirts.
Commercial support is available from third party contractors
and companies.
