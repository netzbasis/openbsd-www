<h3>Security Holes Found in Microsoft Products;<br>
Netscape Also Reports Security Bug</h3>
<h2>Security Experts Say Proprietary Code Isn't Scrutinized Well Enough</h2>
<strong>

WASHINGTON, D.C. - A report by the Wall Street Journal Friday on a security
flaw in Microsoft's Web server software that, under the right conditions
could compromise Web sites, has fueled long-standing concerns about the
security of Microsoft products in general, and has raised the decibel level
of the debate over the need for closer scrutiny of proprietary coding for
potentially damaging security flaws before a product is released.
<p>
Meanwhile, but apparently drowned out by all the mainstream reporting on the
new Microsoft flaw -- which Microsoft now says is not as serious as it
initially conceded -- was the <a
href="http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article/0,2171,4_340591,00.html">report
last Thursday by InternetNews.com</a> about how the developer of the
highly-rated e-commerce Dansie Shopping Cart stands
accused of building a backdoor into the program that could give him or
hackers complete control of the server on which it is installed.
The Dansie Shopping Cart, named after its developer, Craig Dansie, is in use
at more than 200 e-commerce sites and is recommended by many Web hosting
providers.
<p>
According to Joe Harris, a technical support representative at Blarg Online
Services in Seattle, a subroutine was programmed into the cart which enables
Danise to use a nine-character form element or password to remotely execute
commands on servers using the broad security privileges usually assigned to
CGI scripts.  "It takes little imagination to dream up the potential havoc
and privacy violations this level of access could result in -- from
stealing private customer records to a full-blown crack of an e-commerce
server," Harris was quoted as saying.
<p>
Information security experts here told SOURCES these problems underscore the
lax scrutiny within the software development industry to looking for
problematic coding.
<p>
"The recent incident of "backdoors" in Microsoft software is indicative of a
fundamental problem that electronic commerce will need to address very soon,"
Jerry Harold, president & co-founder of <a
href="http://www.netsec.net/">NetSec</a>, told SOURCES in an interview.
"Commercial software generally is built for functionality and is based on
proprietary code that is developed and tested behind closed doors. Even if
Microsoft has stringent internal requirements for software assurance, it's
very difficult to catch a backdoor that may be hidden by a single coder deep
inside hundreds of thousands of lines of code," said Harold, who previously
was a computer security engineer for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).
<p>
"In this environment, independent analysis for security weaknesses is
essential, but nearly impossible to perform on proprietary source. Effective
security must be built into a product from the ground up, throughout design,
development, and independent testing. [And] I'm not just referring to the
security features of a product, such as passwords and encrypted data
transmission."
<p>
Harold said "a secure product or device must start with a secure operating
system as the foundation for the entire product. If the underlying operating
system is insecure, then you've got problems that can be expensive or
impossible to eliminate."
Harold emphasized that "if a company's success depends on trusted and secure
transactions, they should think long and hard about their choice of software."
<p>
For its part, Microsoft has been plagued by a series of discoveries in recent
years of so-called "backdoors" that could be exploited by hackers.
In the Journal report Friday, unidentified Microsoft programmers secretly
inserted a "trojan horse"-like password into the company's Internet server
software that reputedly allows illicit back door entry to potentially
hundreds of thousands of Web sites.
As initially reported, the breach could give hackers access to users' credit
card numbers and login and password information.
<p>
Russ Cooper, who operates the <a href="http://www.ntbugtraq.com/">NTBugtraq</a>
discussion forum, was quoted by the Journal as saying the backdoor password
threatens "almost every Web-hosting provider ... It's a serious flaw. Chances
are, you're going to find some major sites that still have it enabled."
The file, called "dvwssr.dll" is installed on Microsoft's Internet-server
software with Frontpage 98 extensions, and can be used to gain access to key
Web site management files.
<p>
The code in three-year-old software was discovered by a Europe-based employee
of the <a href="http://www.ClientLogic.com">ClientLogic Corp.</a> in
Nashville, Tenn., and a professional security consultant known as 
<a href="http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/">Rain Forest Puppy</a>, who 
<a href="http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/p/doc.asp?id=45&iface=2">reportedly
said</a> he was made aware of the code by a ClientLogic employee.
Microsoft reportedly acknowledged the existence of the back door code and
urged customers to delete the "dvwssr.dll" file.
Steve Lipner, the manager of Microsoft's security-response center, was quoted
by the Journal initially  as saying the backdoor password was "absolutely
against our policy" and indicated that the engineer(s) responsible would be
fired.
<p>
It is unclear how long Microsoft has been aware of the security flaw. The
code was apparently inserted in 1997, at about the time Netscape
Communications Corp. and Microsoft were locked in battle over their
respective versions of Internet-browsers.
Accompanying the code is the buried comment, "!seineew era sreenigne
epacsteN," the backwards spelling of, "Netscape engineers are weenies!"
New analysis of the security hole, however, refutes the Journal's initial
report that a Microsoft employee deliberately put a back door in a module
installed by Microsoft's Web server software.
<p>
Cooper said the flaw is just a bug, not a surreptitious back-door.
"This is a hole that could allow information to be manipulated by others,"
Cooper wrote on the NTBugTraq Web site. "However, it's limited to 'others'
who already have Web authoring permissions on the same box."
According to Microsoft, the phrase is not a password but instead a cypher key
that is used to scramble the address of Web pages that users request.
The "Netscape weenies" file does not allow the security breach; instead, the
"weenies" phrase is a way to access the security hole, a spokesman said,
adding a hacker using the phrase would also author privileges in order to
gain read-only access to Active Server Pages files.
<p>
In Feb., a report by France's Strategic Affairs Delegation (DAS), the
intelligence arm of the French Defense Ministry, was made public in which it
accused agents of the NSA of working with Microsoft to develop software to
allow the spy agency to eavesdrop on communications around the world.
Written by a senior officer at the DAS, the report claims agents of the NSA
worked to install secret programs on Microsoft software.
Microsoft considers such allegations "ludicrous," and has denied previous
similar assertions.
<p>
Microsoft came under fire for a peculiar eavesdropping feature of its
Internet Explorer several years ago which certainly left observers wondering
whether Explorer was surreptitiously embedded with a program deliberately
intended to allow Internet users' hard drives to be spied on.
Several intelligence community sources told SOURCES at the time that their
respective organizations knew in advance of public disclosure of the feature
that it was capable of being used to read the contents of a computer
connected to the Internet at the ISP level.
The controversy erupted when Microsoft sent the beta version of Windows '95
to be tested at MIT, the University of Melbourne, and other universities.
During the testing it was discovered that there was a subroutine that, when
you connected to the Microsoft Network, caused a "registration" program to
automatically kick in that read the names of programs on the subscriber's
hard drive.
<p>
If the computer had a modem connected to a phone line, the computer
automatically dialed MSN and uploaded the information without the user's
permission, and often without the user knowing what was happening.
Consequently, a U.S. Air Force directive instructed its units not to register
Win 95 on-line because Microsoft's scanner program will submit back to
Microsoft whatever is on the user's hard drive.
When questioned about the subroutine, which was an "undocumented feature," of
the program, Microsoft said it only read the names of programs and the
information was being used for marketing purposes.
But testers at the University of Melbourne reportedly found that they could
use the program to read the names of all files on the disk. MIT was also able
to do this, and a tester there said that if one can read the names of files,
one can retrieve them. Another unresolved issue was whether Microsoft could
invoke that program at a later date and, once again, have access to the
user's hard drive information.
Faced with an international outcry, Microsoft said it would give notice that
the program was there and to modify it to only search for a limited number of
specific programs; 100 in all. Microsoft also changed the program to where it
notified the owner that the program was there and gave them the choice of
using on-line registration or not, with the default being that the user had
to actively choose to use this feature.
<p>
"This is why NetSec builds its products on an operating system (OpenBSD) that
has made security its number one goal," Harold told SOURCES. "The source for
the operating system was re-built from the ground up for security and is
publicly available. As a result, it is continuously subjected to rigorous
security review by independent software engineers around the world. This has
additional benefits because secure code often tends to be well designed,
stable, and efficient."
<p>
Hammering his message home is
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1717460.html">today's
report</a> -- less than a week after
the revelation that it's Web server software has a security flaw, that
Microsoft is looking into another newly discovered security hole in its
Communicator Web browser that could expose people's private files to
malicious Web site operators.
<p>
Meanwhile, Netscape also is testing patches for a newly discovered security
hole in its Web browser which also could allow a hostile Web site glean
private information on visitors.
Netscape concedes that the flaw isn't isolated to any one aspect of the
popular browser, but rather with a combination of technologies.
