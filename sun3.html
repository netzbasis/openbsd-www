OpenBSD/sun3 used to run on the Motorola 68020-based Sun3 computers, except
for the 3/E flavour and the 3/50.

<p>
<strong>The OpenBSD/sun3 port was discontinued after the 2.9 release.</strong>

<h3 id="history"><strong>History:</strong></h3>

<p>
The Sun3 port of OpenBSD was derived from the NetBSD/sun3 port, when the
sun3 and sun3x ports were still different entities. Noone showed much
interest in OpenBSD/sun3 for a while, although the code was mostly kept in
sync with NetBSD.

<p>
Eventually, Kenneth Stailey started working on the port, but since he was
living in the USA, he could not export a release he would have built, so he
lost interest working on this port.

<p>
Early 2000, Miod Vallat attempted to bring the port back in shape, making
the code compile again, and devising completely new installation media. The
port even shipped with complete X Window System client and utilities, although
there was no working X server.

<p>
The port lived for a few releases, but unfortunately hardware problems and
lack of time conspired to prevent catching up with NetBSD on code, and the
sun3 code was not ready for the switch from the old Mach virtual memory
system to
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/uvm.9">uvm</a>,
and missed the 3.0 release, hoping that the code would be fixed in time
for the 3.1 release. Unfortunately, this has not been the case, and eventually
it was decided to remove the code from the tree.
