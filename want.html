<h2><font color="#e00000">Hardware wanted</font></h2>
<hr>

The following list outlines hardware that the OpenBSD project could use.
There are a number of reasons why developers need hardware, and it is important
to first of all realize these reasons:
<ul>
<li>To support a specific device, normally one which is more rare or new.
<li>To be part of their development environment.
<li>Some types of machines may be different in some way
    (i.e. big-endian or unsigned-char) and ensure that developers
    write code more carefully.
<li>That said, space or power may be at a premium for some people.
</ul>
<p>

If you do not own these devices, but want to help us, we recommend you
search on <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> for the devices.  If
you do the bidding and then get the device shipped to us, it really
helps us.  It is better if developers develop, and skip the bidding process,
since any time saved can be spent on improving OpenBSD instead.<p>

If it is clear which specific developer should be contacted, please do
so directly.  Otherwise contact <a href="mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org">Theo de Raadt</a>
who will pass on the message to whichever developers are in need.<p>

Please be very clear as to where you are located!!  For larger items this
can be very important.

<hr>

<h3><font color="#e00000">Specific developers to contact for various reasons</font></h3>
<ul>
<li>miod@openbsd.org and martin@openbsd.org for "older hardware" in Europe.
<li>deraadt@openbsd.org for any general offers or questions.
</ul>
If you do not get a response from these developers, please consider
contacting another developer.
<p>

<h3><font color="#e00000">General device requirements.</font></h3>
We try to spread these types of devices around our development community.
<ul>
<li><em>Narrow SCSI</em> disk drives of 2GB or more, 3.5" size.
    (Narrow SCSI means 50pin).<br>
    Many developers are running out of these drives, which are needed
    to continue supporting older hardware.<br>
<li>Laptops.  These die often enough that our developers need about 2-3
    replacements a year.
<li>Apple Mac powerpc equipment.
<li>HP J6750 machines (J6700 is the second best choice).
<li>Faster &amp; smaller sparc64 machines, for instance 1U rack mount
    machines.  It is important to spread sparc64 around the development
    community, since it is the most strict platform for detecting non-portable
    or buggy code.
<li>Any amd64 or faster i386 hardware which comes available.
<li>We generally do not need older and "very common" ISA/PCI equipment, since
    our developers will generally have gotten their hands on these in the
    past.
</ul>
<p>

<h3><font color="#e00000">10Gb Ethernet Support</font></h3>
David Gwynne (in Australia), Mike Belopuhov (in Germany), and Claudio Jeker (in
Switzerland) are working on support for 10 Gigabit Ethernet devices. These
developers would like the following hardware to help development:
<ul>
  <li>10GbaseSR SFP+ modules for use in 10Gb network cards
  <li>Switches with 10Gb modules for hacking
  <li>Direct Attach (SFP+) and CX4 cabling
  <li>optical cabling with LC connectors (for 10GbaseSR and 10GbaseLR)
  <li>Broadcom, Emulex (ServerEngines) and QLogic 10Gb NICs for driver
      development
</ul>
Contact dlg@openbsd.org, mikeb@openbsd.org, and claudio@openbsd.org.
