<h3>How to install</h3>
<p>
Following this are the instructions which you would have on a piece of
paper if you had purchased a CDROM set instead of doing an alternate
form of install.  The instructions for doing an FTP (or other style
of) install are very similar; the CDROM instructions are left intact
so that you can see how much easier it would have been if you had
purchased a CDROM instead.

<section id=quickinstall>

<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the
use of the "disklabel -E" command.  If you are at all confused when
installing OpenBSD, read the relevant INSTALL.* file as listed above!

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
Play with your BIOS options to enable booting from a CD. The OpenBSD/i386
release is on CD1. If your BIOS does not support booting from CD, you will need
to create a boot floppy to install from. To create a boot floppy write
<i>CD1:4.8/i386/floppy48.fs</i> to a floppy and boot via the floppy drive.

<p>
Use <i>CD1:4.8/i386/floppyB48.fs</i> instead for greater SCSI controller
support, or <i>CD1:4.8/i386/floppyC48.fs</i> for better laptop support.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD or a floppy disk,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<p>
To make a boot floppy under MS-DOS, use the &quot;rawrite&quot; utility located
at <i>CD1:4.8/tools/rawrite.exe</i>. To make the boot floppy under a Unix OS,
use the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dd.1">dd(1)</a>
utility. The following is an example usage of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dd.1">dd(1)</a>,
where the device could be &quot;floppy&quot;, &quot;rfd0c&quot;, or
&quot;rfd0a&quot;.

<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>dd if=&lt;file&gt; of=/dev/&lt;device&gt; bs=32k</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Make sure you use properly formatted perfect floppies with NO BAD BLOCKS or
your install will most likely fail. For more information on creating a boot
floppy and installing OpenBSD/i386 please refer to
<a href="faq/faq4.html#MkFlop">this page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
The 4.8 release of OpenBSD/amd64 is located on CD2.
Boot from the CD to begin the install - you may need to adjust
your BIOS options first.
If you can't boot from the CD, you can create a boot floppy to install from.
To do this, write <i>CD2:4.8/amd64/floppy48.fs</i> to a floppy, then
boot from the floppy drive.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD or a floppy disk,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Put CD2 in your CDROM drive and poweron your machine while holding down the
<i>C</i> key until the display turns on and shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/4.8/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Put CD3 in your CDROM drive and type <i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>CD3:4.8/sparc64/floppy48.fs</i> or <i>CD3:4.8/sparc64/floppyB48.fs</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>CD3:4.8/sparc64/miniroot48.fs</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>4.8/alpha/floppy48.fs</i> or
<i>4.8/alpha/floppyB48.fs</i> (depending on your machine) to a diskette and
enter <i>boot dva0</i>. Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<h3>OpenBSD/armish:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, Thecus can boot directly from the network
either tftp or http. Configure the network using fconfig, reset,
then load bsd.rd, see INSTALL.armish for specific details.
IOData HDL-G can only boot from an EXT-2 partition. Boot into linux
and copy 'boot' and bsd.rd into the first partition on wd0 (hda1)
then load and run bsd.rd, preserving the wd0i (hda1) ext2fs partition.
More details are available in INSTALL.armish.

<h3>OpenBSD/hp300:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hp300.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot48.fs</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot48.fs</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/mvme68k:</h3>

<p>
You can create a bootable installation tape or boot over the network.<br>
The network boot requires a MVME68K BUG version that supports the <i>NIOT</i>
and <i>NBO</i> debugger commands. Follow the instructions in INSTALL.mvme68k
for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/mvme88k:</h3>

<p>
You can create a bootable installation tape or boot over the network.<br>
The network boot requires a MVME88K BUG version that supports the <i>NIOT</i>
and <i>NBO</i> debugger commands. Follow the instructions in INSTALL.mvme88k
for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sgi:</h3>

<p>
To install on an O2, burn cd48.iso on a CD-R, put it in the CD drive of your
machine and select <i>Install System Software</i> from the System Maintenance
menu.

<p>
On other systems, or if your machine doesn't have a CD drive, you can
setup a DHCP/tftp network server, and boot using "bootp()/bsd.rd.IP##" using
the kernel matching your system type.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/socppc:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.socppc for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc:</h3>

<p>
Boot from one of the provided install ISO images, using one of the two
commands listed below, depending on the version of your ROM.

<blockquote><pre>
ok <kbd>boot cdrom 4.8/sparc/bsd.rd</kbd>
or
> <kbd>b sd(0,6,0)4.8/sparc/bsd.rd</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If your SPARC system does not have a CD drive, you can alternatively boot from floppy.
To do so you need to write <i>floppy48.fs</i> to a floppy.
For more information see <a href="faq/faq4.html#MkFlop">this page</a>.
To boot from the floppy use one of the two commands listed below,
depending on the version of your ROM.

<blockquote><pre>
ok <kbd>boot floppy</kbd>
or
> <kbd>b fd()</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
If your SPARC system doesn't have a floppy drive nor a CD drive, you can either
setup a bootable tape, or install via network, as told in the
INSTALL.sparc file.

<h3>OpenBSD/vax:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network via mopbooting as described in INSTALL.vax.

<h3>OpenBSD/zaurus:</h3>

<p>
Using the Linux built-in graphical ipkg installer, install the
openbsd48_arm.ipk package.  Reboot, then run it.  Read INSTALL.zaurus
for a few important details.

<section id=sourcecode>
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources, which are
in a separate archive.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<section id=upgrade>
<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 4.7 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade48.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=ports>
<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> subdirectory is a checkout of the OpenBSD ports tree.  Go
read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS (see the manpage for
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cvs.1">cvs(1)</a> if
you aren't familiar with CVS) checkout of our ports.  As with our complete
source tree, our ports tree is available via anoncvs.  So, in
order to keep current with it, you must make the <i>ports/</i> tree
available on a read-write medium and update the tree with a command
like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd [portsdir]/; cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_4_8</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the local directory and server name here
with the location of your ports collection and a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
packages for the 4.8 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
