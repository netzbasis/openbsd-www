Goals
</h2>
<hr>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lean:</strong>
    Provide a small and monolithic architecture that supports
    the main standards and most important features of IKEv2.
    Monolithic means that we do not even try to put lots of features in
    lots of dynamic libraries.
<li><strong>Clean:</strong>
    Write readable and clean code following strict coding
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/style.9">style(9)</a>
    guidelines.
<li><strong>Secure:</strong>
    Implement secure code with strict validity checking, bounded buffer
    operations, and privilege separation to mitigate the security risks of
    possible bugs. Use strong cryptography with sane but secure defaults.
<li><strong>Interoperable:</strong>
    Provide good interoperability with other IKEv2 implementations, support
    non-standard extensions if it is required to interoperate with other
    major implementations.
<li><strong>Configurable:</strong>
    Make the configuration easy and nice with sane defaults, minimalistic
    configuration files and good documentation in the manual pages. Avoid
    the headaches of past and other IKE implementations.
</ul>
