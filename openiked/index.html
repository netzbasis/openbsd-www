	OpenIKED is part of OpenBSD since November 2010.

<p>
OpenIKED is a <strong>FREE</strong> implementation of the Internet Key Exchange
(IKEv2) protocol which performs mutual authentication and which
establishes and maintains IPsec VPN security policies and associations
(SAs) between peers. The IKEv2 protocol is defined in RFC 5996, which
combines and updates the previous standards: ISAKMP/Oakley (RFC 2408),
IKE (RFC 2409), and the Internet DOI (RFC 2407). OpenIKED only supports
the IKEv2 protocol; support for ISAKMP/Oakley and IKEv1 is provided by
OpenBSD's <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd.8">isakmpd(8)</a>
or other implementations on non-OpenBSD platforms.

<p>
It is intended to be a lean, clean, secure, better configurable and
interoperable implementation that focusses on supporting the main
standards and most important features of IKEv2. 
OpenIKED was written by Reyk Floeter and is primarily developed with
Mike Belopuhov and various contributing
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> hackers.

<p>
OpenIKED is developed as part of <a href="https://www.openbsd.org">the
OpenBSD Project</a>.  The software is freely usable and re-usable by
everyone under an ISC license.

<p>
OpenIKED is developed entirely by volunteers.
Contributions to
<a href="https://www.openbsdfoundation.org">The OpenBSD Foundation</a>
support the development of this and other OpenBSD projects.
